Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'til you spend half your life just covering up

Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Born in the U.S.A.

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said "son, don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.



So, you see
You've got me back again for more
And it seems
Your song is in my head
This is war
Mystery
how I could feel you breathe me, I was sure
you would keep
Every promise
you would keep every word

Well I try to put your stories in line
But nothing adds up right

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited

It's a shame
That you left me hanging like you did
It was brave
But it was much more foolish
Don't you think?

'Cause you know I won't be satisfied
Until you realize

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
You're not invited

These things are oh all so typical
These things are unforgivable
I'm gone and you're invisible now

Don't let me catch you following
Don't ask, 'cause I'm not offering
You've caused enough of my suffering, oh

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited



Day is ending
Birds are wending
Back to the shelter of
Each little nest they love

Nightshades falling
Lovebirds calling
What makes the world go round?
Nothing but love

When Whip-poor-wills call
And ev'ning is nigh
I hurry to
My blue heaven

I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to
My blue heaven

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace
A cozy room
A little nest
That's nestled where
The roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in
My blue heaven

Doo doo doo doo doo
Da da da da da

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace
A cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in
My blue heaven

We're happy in my blue heaven



Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another round, another round, another round,
Another I could feel it now.
I felt the Lord in my father's house.

Well, I could see, I could see
Standing we were seventeen make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you giving me the best of me.
We, will see.

'Cause I'm done being done with the funerals at least for now
Are you tired of being alone, are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out.
Tie it up another round another
Wasn't really what I wanted so we brought it out.
Over the shore to my neighbors house.
I could see I could see
God I never should have seen, so complete
I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally, God just speak.

'Cause I'm done being done with the funerals at least for now
Are you tired of being alone, are you tired of being alone?

Just be clean

Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta take it out, take it down
I gotta jump around, I needed that more then I ever have.
Oh god you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta break it down, break it out
You gotta jump around, I feel it now more than I ever have.

I felt the world begin
To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal the bigger mess
That you can't fix

I felt I felt good
Repeat into my home
Don't fight don't ever go
I swear you'll never know
You'll never know

Oh god you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta break it down, break it out



Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly
So he never did land
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
Tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love
Pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance?
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?
Na na na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Na na na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star
Na na na
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there



Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
(Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody



I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
But nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy
four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on



A long time ago, yeah
Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great
I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
Dancing to Zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck
If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
Wondering what a city boy could do
To get her in a conversation
Drink a little red wine
Dance to the music of Clifton Chenier
The King of the Bayou

Well, that was your mother
And that was your father
Before you was born dude
When life was great
You are the burden of my generation
I sure do love you
But let's get that straight

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
Across the street from The Public
Heading down to the Lone Star Cafe
Maybe get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Standing in the shadow of Clifton Chenier
Dancing the night away



We swung our feet off of the edge of the moon
We got that high for a minute
Sometimes forever gets away from you
No matter how hard you grip it

Sorry the sky fell down
Sorry I don't know why
All we do is apologize

Oh, but I'll never be sorry for my hands in the pockets
Of your hoodie, called you "Sugar" just to make you smile
And I'll never be sorry for the shoes that I bought you
In Chicago, we were walking down the Miracle Mile
Oh I, oh I

I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry (ooh)
I'll never be sorry for loving you (ooh)
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry (ooh)
I'll never be sorry for loving you

Sometimes two people end up victims of love
It don't work out like you planned it (oh, no, no, no)
Just 'cause we couldn't get the stars to line up
Don't mean we leave empty-handed

Sorry the sun came up
Sorry the second verse
Just wasn't as sweet as the first

Oh, but I'll never be sorry for that night in Santa Barbara
We got locked out of your car in the pouring rain
And I'll never be sorry for missing the party
'Cause the way your body looked in that dress blew me away
Oh I, oh I

I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you

Oh I, oh I

I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry, baby
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you

Yeah, I'll never be sorry for my hands in the pockets
Of your hoodie, called you "Sugar" just to make you smile
Yeah, I'll never be sorry for the shoes that I bought you
In Chicago, we were walking down the Miracle Mile
Oh I, oh I

I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry (oh, I'll never be sorry)
I'll never be sorry for loving you (I'll never be)
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry (I'll never be sorry)
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry

You put the boom boom into my heart,
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts.
Jitterbug into my brain,
Goes bang bang bang 'til my feet do the same.
But something's bugging me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me
Where you were last night.
Left me sleeping
In my bed.
I was dreaming
But I should've been with you instead.
Wake me up before you go go,
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.
Wake me up before you go go,
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go go,
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo.
Wake me up before you go go,
Take me dancing tonight.
I want to hit that high
You get the gray skies outta my way,
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.
Turn a mere spark into a flame,
My beats per minute never been the same.
'Cause you're my lady,
I'm your fool.
Makes me crazy
When you act so cruel.
C'mon baby,
Let's not fight.
We'll go dancing
And everything will be alright.
Wake me up before you go go,
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.
Wake me up before you go go,
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go go,
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo.
Wake me up before you go go,
Take me dancing tonight.
I want to hit that high
Cuddle up baby,
Move in tight.
We'll go dancing tomorrow night.
It's cold out there
But it's warm in bed.
They can dance,
We'll stay home instead.




They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time

The man said, why do you think you here?
I said, I got no idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go

Turn me on, turn me off, then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Let's cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand?
Are we last-call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years?
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand?

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips, call me yours and forget all this drama (forget it all)
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause I’m tired of asking myself (tired of asking myself)

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand?
Are we last-call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't?
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand?

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand? (wash right off my hand)
Are we last-call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years?
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand?
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand?



Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
can you picture this?

Dream if you can
A courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry.

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
(A world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
(Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
(Ya know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
(Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied
(She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
(Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Don't cry (Don't Cry)

When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry

When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't don't cry



I'd put the whiskey back in the bottle
Put the smoke back in the joint
Look up at the sky and say
Ok, ok, ok, think you made your point
I'd cover up the pool at Skymont
I'd take some girls out of my phone
Give the nightlife back to Nashville
One night at a time 'til all the regret's gone

And I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
And hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you

I thought I wanted my freedom
I told myself I'd have a ball
But it turns out goin' out and chasin'
Dreams and lonely women ain't freedom after all
If I could go back now
And take it back somehow

I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all fixed up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you

If I could wrangle all my sins
Take 'em back and make amends
And do it all over again
I'd take the wrongs and make 'em right
All the lonesome lonely nights
Pack 'em up and haul 'em all back home to you

And I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And all the lonely nights in between
And give 'em back to you
Give it all back to you



Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'mma go on and take a swing

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, laying next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs



Hey

One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow (hey)
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)

You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance (yeah, yeah)
You're looking for a little more consistency (I know)
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's (hey)
I feel my old flings was just preparing me (me)
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma "at" this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'd get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me




Bows and flows of angel hair
and ice cream castles in the air
and feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
but clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down, and still somehow
it's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way you feel
as every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
and if you care don't let them know
don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
from give and take, and still somehow
it's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
to say "I love you" right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
they shake their heads, they say I've changed
Something's lost but something's gained
in living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
from win and lose, and still somehow
it's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all



Midnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
So won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done

Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
So hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one

And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts



I can see you over there
Staring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink
All alone tonight
And chances are
You're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right

Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while
Baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

I'm not tryna
Be another just
Pick you up
Kinda guy
Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home
But I just don't understand
How another man
Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold

Well, I've had enough to drink
And it's makin'
Me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright
Baby

'Cause blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

No, no, no, mmm
It ain't your color, baby
Mmm, baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

Blue ain't your color, mmm, mmm
No, no baby
Huh, come here, baby
Let me light up your world



On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A.
or New York or Santa Fe
or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you
'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed
and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy
looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
mmm way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile
you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the "how you been"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you
until I came to
And I was overwhelmed
and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy
looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe
that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true, 'cause

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy
looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me
everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
mmm the way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by



I'm wearin'
Fur pajamas
I ride a
Hot Potata

It's tickling
my fancy
Speak up
I can't hear you

Here on this mountain top, woah oh oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell ya, oh oh
About some wild, wild life
Here comes the doctor in charge, woah oh oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it oh oh
Living wild, wild life

I wrestle
with your conscience
You wrestle
with your partner

Sittin' on a window sill, but he
Spends time behind closed doors

Check out Mr. Businessman, woah oh oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange, oh oh oh
He got some wild, wild life
Break it up when he opens the door, oh oh oh
He's doin' wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it oh oh
Living wild, wild

Peace of mind?
It's a Piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any
time you like

Like sittin' on
pins and needles
Things fall apart
it's scientific

Sleeping on the interstate, oh oh oh
Getting wild, wild life
Checkin' in
a checkin' out oh oh oh
I got a wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time oh oh oh
Done too much wild, wild
We want to go, where we go, where we go oh oh oh
doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start oh oh oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture, here in the daylight oh oh
They got some wild wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast ah oh oh
Wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it oh oh
Living wild wild wild wild
life



November's almost over
The gentle winter's on the way
Still I sit here on this balcony
And smoke my brain away

Waiting on that phone to ring
Wondering which day that it will be

Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong
And leave all the pain you've felt from me
Here in Missouri

Oh you were just a young girl
And I swore I could change
Every day that you forgive me
Is just another one you'll waste

You came here in search of something true
I hope like hell your searching isn't through

Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong
And leave all the pain you've felt from me
Here in Missouri

It's hard to think that everything around her
To know that won't be happy ever after

Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong
And leave all the pain you've felt from me
Here in Missouri

Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong
And leave all the pain you've felt from me
Here in Missouri



My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo

Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on, skip a couple rocks with me

Gimme any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got somethin' we could start tonight
Lookin' at you, girl, it's hard to fight

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes, baby, they're fixed on you
in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
in your snapback

Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
In your snapback

Come on baby shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my lock screen
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we got the beat, let's drop it

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes, baby, they're fixed on you
in your snapback
Tattoos, cutoffs and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works, in your snapback

Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
In your snapback

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes, baby, they're fixed on you
in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can, in your snapback

Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh
In your snapback

I'm lost in the light
I pray for the night
To take me, to take you too
After so many words
Still nothing's heard
Don't know what we should do
So if someone could see me now let them see you

Was my greatest thrill
When we just stood still
You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill
Even counting sheep
Don't help me sleep
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
So if someone could help me now
They'd help you too

They'd help you too
See you through
All the hard things
we've all gotta do
'Cause this life is long
So you wouldn't be wrong
Being free, leaving me on my own

And I held my own
Still I rattled your bones
I said some awful things and I take them back
If we would try again
Just remember when
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
So if someone could see me now
Let them see you

Let them see you
See you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
'Cause this life is long
So you wouldn't be wrong
Being free, leaving me on my own



Don't tell me you don't know what love is
When you're old enough to know better
When you find strange hands in your sweater
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote
I'm a man with a mission in two or three editions

And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book

Chapter One
we didn't really get along
Chapter Two
I think I fell in love with you
You said you'd stand by me
in the middle of Chapter Three
But you were up to your old tricks
in Chapters Four, Five and Six

And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book

The way you walk
The way you talk, and try to kiss me, and laugh
In four or five paragraphs
All your compliments and your cutting remarks
Are captured here in my quotation marks

And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book
everyday I write the book

Don't tell me you don't know the difference
Between a lover and a fighter
With my pen and my electric typewriter
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book
Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book




Wipe the tears away, wipe the tears away
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday

I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? how long...

'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday (sunday bloody sunday...)
(lets go!)

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? how long...

'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...
Tonight...

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday (sunday bloody sunday...)

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away

And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
On...

The real battle yet begun
To claim the victory jesus won

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday



In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun

Hang my head, drown my fear 'til you all just disappear

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come



It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you

Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, and Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend (so lonely)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend (so lonely)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend (so lonely)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend



If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me
climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep
somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

"I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go."

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always
somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
somewhere with you

Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you



I ain't rich
but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day
ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can't buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat
it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck
white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that
if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

'Cause it could buy me a boat
it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sittin' on a hundred mill
Well, that'll buy me a brand new rod and reel

And it could buy me a boat
it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it can buy me a boat
It can buy me a boat

Yeah it can buy me a boat

Waking up in the sand
Sunburn on your nose
You scream and squeezed my hand
When your East Kentucky toes
hit the Atlantic

Summertime in Brooklyn
Mustard on your lip
I knew I loved you by the bottom of the fifth
I never planned it

A million perfect moments
Go rushing through my brain
Our first trip to the ocean
Your first time on a plane
When you look over your shoulder
Baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

The dress that you were wearing
Soaking up the stains
I can still see your mascara though I can't recall the pain
Of what came after

You were even beautiful
Telling me goodbye
Maybe my version of the truth is just a lie
What does it matter?
What does it matter?

A million perfect moments
Go rushing through my brain
Every time I smell October
You're standing in the rain
When you look over your shoulder
Baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

I've forgot the bitter
The winter's just a blur
I savor the sweet as if the summer's all we were
And ever will be, oh, and I still see

A million perfect moments
Go rushing through my brain
Every time I touch the ocean
Anytime I taste the rain
When you look over your shoulder
Baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
Yeah, remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you
That's how I'll remember you



I am woman, hear me roar
In numbers too big to ignore
And I know too much to go back an' pretend
'Cause I've heard it all before
And I've been down there on the floor
No one's ever gonna keep me down again

Oh yes I am wise
But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything
I am strong (strong)
I am invincible (invincible)
I am woman

You can bend but never break me
'Cause it only serves to make me
More determined to achieve my final goal
And I come back even stronger
Not a novice any longer
'Cause you've deepened the conviction in my soul

Oh yes I am wise
But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything
I am strong (strong)
I am invincible (invincible)
I am woman

I am woman watch me grow
See me standing toe to toe
As I spread my lovin' arms across the land
But I'm still an embryo
With a long long way to go
Until I make my brother understand

Oh yes I am wise
But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to I can face anything
I am strong (strong)
I am invincible (invincible)
I am woman
Oh, I am woman
I am invincible
I am strong
I am woman
I am invincible
I am strong
I am woman



You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me
You know I can't believe it
when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me
You know I don't believe you
when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find, you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't, don't you want me
You know I can't believe it
when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me
You know I don't believe you
when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find, you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me, oh




Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye of the tiger

It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger



Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you
And you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
So happy together
How is the weather
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together



Now a red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbeques tailgates fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass

A red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not foreclosable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass woo

Red solo cup

I love you red solo cup

Proceed to party

Now I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well that my friends is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring how sharply my first name is written
On you with a sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
let's have a party
I love you red solo cup
I lift you up

But only you red will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbot unto my Costello
And you are the fruit to my loom

Red solo cup you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red solo cup, you're not just a cup. (No, no, God no)
You're my, you're my friend. (Friend, friend, friend, life long)
Thank you for being my friend

Red solo cup

If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do whatever you want
So

Make lots of noise (hey)
Kiss lots of boys (yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint
Or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row
You're a self-righteous son of a
Can't win for losing
You'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em

So make lots of noise (hey)
Kiss lots of boys (yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint

When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint
I would
And follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points



I remember you so clearly
The first one through the door
And I return to find you drifting
Too far from the shore

I remember feeling this way
You can lose it without knowing
You wake up and you don't notice
Which way the wind is blowing

Don't fade
No, don't fade on me

You were the one who made things different
You were the one who took me in
You were the one thing I could count on
Above all you were my friend

So, don't fade
Don't fade on me (don't do it)

Well your clothes hang on a wire
And the sun is overhead
But today you are too weary
To even leave your bed

Was it love that took you under?
Or did you know too much?
Was it something you could picture?
But never could quite touch?

Don't fade
No, don't fade on me
Said "Don't fade"
Hey, don't fade on me



I see me with you and all the things you do
Keep turning round and round in my mind
Forget the weather we should always be together
And any other thought is unkind

To have you with me I would swim the seven seas
To have you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together
We'll be together tonight

We'll be together yeah
We'll be together yeah
We'll be together, yeah

I see you with me and all I want to be
Is dancing here with you in my arms
Forget the weather we should always be together
I'll always be a slave to your charms

To have you with me I would swim the seven seas
To have you as the guide in my life
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together
We'll be together

We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah

She looked so much like a lady, but she was so much like a child.
A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew
She'd go away when the grass turned green
And the sky turned baby blue.

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart

Every time you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh



You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing, yeah

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

Oh, I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah



When you grow up, livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama, takes a shine to her best son
Something different, all the girls they seem to like you
'Cause you're handsome, like to talk, and a whole lot of fun

But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said

We're gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah, we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing, oh, the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man

It's a struggle, livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer, watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama, heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you, that all she'd want to do is cry

Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just been towed

We're gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing, oh, the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man

Cup of milk, let's rock and roll

Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's gettin' kinda cold in these painted-on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
(Yeah, baby)

I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' in
Sayin', "Hey girl", but you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name, and to you it ain't
Pretty little thing, honey or baby
It's drivin' me red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck crazy

Bein' the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't ever made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time you gotta get you some of that
Sure I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped, huh
These days it ain't easy being that

Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is looking good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

Yep, yep, yeah baby
Aw naw
Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw naw
We ain't a cliche
That ain't no way
To treat a lady

Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song

Yeah baby
I ain't your tan legged Juliet
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw naw



There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven



I'm leaving
Words fall out my mouth
And onto the floor
I'm needing
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door

This is goodbye
I'll roll the windows down
On my green Chevrolet
Don't know where I'm going
I just know I can't stay

Might make it to Memphis
But that ain't far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missoula
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind

I'm thinking
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
That I'm drinking
And I'm hurting like hell
But honey how could I not be
You made me

The joker the fool
Yeah, the last one to know
I'm gonna put mountains and rivers and deserts between us
Go as far as I can go

Might make it to Memphis
But that ain't far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missoula
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind

Might leave some tears in Topeka
A couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne
Every time that I miss you
I'll hit the gas as fast as I can

Might make it to Memphis
Past those Kansas City lights
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind



I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy



Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changing my mind

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?

I wouldn't last a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was living life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did is make you all mine

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman, come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?
Like crazy, girl

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately I love you like crazy, girl?

Like crazy
Oh crazy girl
Like crazy
Oh crazy girl



Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
And when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man baby
but I'm showing you the door

'Cause I gotta have Faith
I gotta have Faith
Because I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith

Baby, I know you're asking me to stay
Saying please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to the loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have Faith
I gotta have Faith
Because I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I've just got to have faith)
I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Yeah, I need someone to hold me
but I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have Faith
I gotta have Faith
Because I've gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith
I gotta have Faith, Faith, Faith



Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dance floor to run on

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

I rushed home from work like I always do
I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door my whole like was changed
'Cause nobody answered when I called your name

A note on the table that told me goodbye
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Your love has ended but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name

Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling
Nobody answers when I call your name

Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling
Nobody answers when I call your name
Oh nobody answers when I call your name



Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say

Is fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Oh, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Oh, fire away
Fire away



She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her grandaddy preaching the service
Yeah, she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we'd been friends for forever
And I always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

Woah, oh oh, oh

Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I'll wish her the best now

So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Woah, but she ain't gonna marry me, oh



Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore



I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on

Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero who appears in you
To clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on

The essence, the basics, without it, you naked
Allow me to make this, childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But the percussion he provides with me as a guide
Y'all can see me now, 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind; that's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on



Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye Bye

Two black Cadillacs
two black Cadillacs

Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then he'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye Bye

Yeah yeah

It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye Bye

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

(Don't, don't, don't)
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)

Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (oh)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
Don't start caring about me now (so)

Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (so)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh



Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting thought the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta

Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt
your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know
You just gotta

Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon




Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive
And a tail light circle

Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a ten you're a nine point nine
Tippin' 'n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt

Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God all mighty

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off all out in the water

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah I'm a little drunk on you



Glitterbug with your mind everywhere
I'm anywhere you want me to be
Take your time but take care
For in the end we're all history
Don't be shy let everyone or me at least inside
You'll be fine; you'll be fine in the morning sunshine
Fine you will find if you're mine you might be free
We shall see
Glitterbug with your eyes through the grey
There's something that I need you to say
Could be Hi, go away
Or anything that makes it ok
From the ground you are the only star that shines tonight
If you go you must know that you'll shine forever
Come if you're mine you will shine eternally
Wait and see
From the bar to the stars
Through the haze of a thousand wasted days
You must be tired you've burned so bright
So goodnight, goodnight Glitterbug



I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine
I'm fine

But when I taste tequila
baby, I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory
it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila
baby, I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible
baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (need you)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (when I, when I, when I)

I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in

When I taste tequila
baby, I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt
the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible
baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (need you)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh
When I taste tequila, oh (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
Oh



Don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lyin'

If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buyin'

Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you

Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?

Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me

I don't mind a little smoke gettin' in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me

Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh

'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no no no
I don't believe in nirvana

But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water

I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week

I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
Oh God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
Oh God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy



A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
Days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lovers sing
"I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
But home was a dream
One I'd never seen 'til you came along

So girl, hang your dress up to dry
We ain't leaving this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones
Like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good



Saturday mornin', jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man
Yeah (yeah)

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both
Standin' at that alter
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' 'tll the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still no

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?
Rude

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but no still means no

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?
Oh, yeah, oh
Why you gotta be so rude?
Why? (Yeah)
Why you gotta be so rude?



Love can go to your head
Like a shot of something strong
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long
Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday morning Sparrow
Love can go to your heart
Like a sweet-talking arrow

Love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love
Can go to hell

I can go to church
Fold these idle hands
I can go to work
Call some friends
Make some plans
I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I'd just wake up hungover
Cursing the day I feel for you

Love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well

I don't blame you at all
No, I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault

So, love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love
Can go to hell
Forever's just a lie that love will tell
So love
Yeah love can go to hell




There I was at the bus stop begging you just to stay
Can we work this out
baby we can work this out
A dust trail from a Greyhound headed for the West Coast
As I watch you leave
it's getting hard to breathe

No this ain't how it was supposed to be
You're out chasing all your dreams
Tell me where does that leave me

What about the plans that you left behind
The little white house by the railway line
The one we picked out
We even put the payment down
What about the promise that you made
To stay with me till your dying day
Said you'd never go away
Are they just things that people say

Are they just things baby

The preacher stopped by the house last Tuesday
Asked if I was fine
We sat and talked a while
He tried to make me smile
But it's so hard to show my face round lately
In this small town
I guess they heard the news
'Bout me and you
It's three a.m. and I can't sleep at all
I wonder where you are tonight and do I ever cross your mind

What about the plans that you left behind
The little white house by the railway line
The one we picked out
We even put the payment down
What about the promise that you made
To stay with me till your dying day
Said you'd never go away
Are they just things that people say

Well my momma won't stop crying
She wonders what went wrong
Could I have loved a little deeper
Or did I hold on too strong

What about the plans that you left behind
The little white house by the railway line
The one we picked out
We even put the payment down
What about the promise that you made
To stay with me till your dying day
Said you'd never go away
Are they just things that people say

Are they just things baby



I catch myself wishing
You were whispering my name
Every star, every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away

I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream, every scene
Every song we'd ever sing
Got lost in yesterday

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

Do you find yourself wondering
If I still think about you
Every thought, every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah, that's all I ever do

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
If I can kiss you tonight

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
If I can kiss you tonight
If I could kiss you tonight



Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hanging from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt
Folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy but that's alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and I've got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down and I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I leave that radio playing
Same old country station where you left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rolling down on my face
Hey, man I'm trying to be tough
And mama asked me this morning, if I'd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain't where I feel you anyway

I drive your truck
I roll every window down and I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I'm missing you this much

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
Brother sometimes

I drive your truck, mm
I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
I drive your truck



Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down the window, where you headed to next?
Said I'm headed to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
I got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened

Whoa, something bad
Whoa, something bad

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
I got a real good feeling something bad about to happen (ooh)
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning' don't know what happened
Whoa, something bad
Whoa, something bad

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning' don't know what happened
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa, something bad
Whoa, something bad



Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live
Oh take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh whoa oh

Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman that's just what you are
yeah you'll smile in my face then rip the breaks out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask

If my body was on fire
Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you love me, you're a liar
'cause you never ever, ever did

But darling I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh whoa oh

Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No no no no no



I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh, la la la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh, la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you

call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, ooh

when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you

call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la la la
It's true, la la la (true, la la)
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya

For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya



Broken bicycles,
Old busted chains,
With busted handle bars
Out in the rain
Somebody must
Have an orphanage for
All these things that nobody
Wants any more

September's reminding July
It's time to be saying goodbye
Summer is gone,
Our love will remain
Like old broken bicycles
Out in the rain

Broken Bicycles,
Don't tell my folks
There's all those playing cards
Pinned to the spokes
Laid down like skeletons
Out on the lawn
The wheels won't turn
When the other has gone

The seasons can turn on a dime
Somehow I forget every time
For all the things that you've given me
Will always stay
Broken, but I'll never throw them away



Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What give me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know what I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

I heard I was a wild one
Acting like a child some
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you



Hey where did we go?
The days when the rains came
Down in the hollow, playing a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey!
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding, all along the waterfall, with you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da
La tee da

So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day, my, you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee da



Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie, but
I don't let them play  (no way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you will see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl



To the bag packed, first love leaver
The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of mama's peach pie

To the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lights

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

We've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Meet a girl outside Atlanta, man
when it's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
You're just singing along with your drink raised
A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night
Yeah, it's making the best of the worst day kind of night

Oh
Here's to the breakups
It's that kinda night



Don't get me wrong, I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride, Brooks & Dunn, B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey, the way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken-in cowboy boots

But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

I like a sunrise, duck blind, birdie on a par 5
Miller Light before noon
I like a two-door old Ford, wood board, back porch
Three chords and the truth

But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you



Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
and you are not me
the lengths that I will go to
the distance in your eyes

oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool

Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees, failed

What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry
Why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream

Dream



A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you



My DNA is running out, 
I am not the guy who makes you smile now
And when we talk, it's not the same, 
but I already lost the gene for feeling pain

So I won't cry, I will just pretend, 
I'm still the one and that we are in love again

But when I call you are never home, 
and I am down to six or seven chromosomes
But you don't care, or understand,
how it feels to be a single double strand

All these molecules don't make me who i am
you did

I'm still the one



We came out West together with a common desire
The fever we had might a set the West Coast on fire
Two months later got a troublin' mind
Maggie moved out and left me behind

But it's alright 'cause it's midnight
I got two more bottles of wine

The way she left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down
Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I've been workin' and I'm too tired anyway

But it's alright 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
Thought I'd be a star by today
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West L.A.

But it's alright 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

Sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
Thought I'd be a star by today
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West L.A.

But it's alright 'cause it's midnight
I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's alright 'cause it's midnight
I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's alright 'cause it's midnight
I got two more bottles of wine



You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else
And I don't need you

What if this goes south
What if I mess you up
You say what if I break your heart
In two then what

Well I hear you girl
I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up
I gotta ask

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game

What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if
I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burning
We could worry about them

What ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you
What if you liked it
(Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't
Never gonna know unless we try it

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game

What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all
These what ifs away

Aw yeah
C'mon

You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and
I don't need you
Damn

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
Yeah

What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up and
It's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these
What if's away

Away
(Away)
What if?



I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so so bad

It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me maybe

And I know she'll be the death of me
at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

And I know she'll be the death of me
at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary
when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face (I can't feel nothing) when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, (but I love it) oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, (but I love it) oh

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it (oh I love it) oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (said I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (face, when I'm with you)
But I love it (but I love it) but I love it, don't you think I can't
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, (when I'm with you baby) but I love it, (when I'm with you baby)
I can't feel my face




Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now

I'm so sick of that same old love
that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love
feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love
the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
'Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now

I'm so sick of that same old love
that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love
feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love
the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that same old love
that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love
feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love
the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)

I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think, or let you see one thing for yourself
But now your off with someone else and I'm alone
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own

Amie what you want to do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Don't you think the time is right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time
And can you see
Which way we should turn together or alone
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
(will it take to long to see)

Amie what you want to do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Well now
Amie what you want to do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Now it's come to what you want you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And can you see
That I don't know if it's you or if it's me
If it's one of us I'm sure we'll both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me

Amie what you want to do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer
Longer if I do

Yeah now
Amie what you want to do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Fallin' in and out of love with you
Fallin' in and out of love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do, I'd keep
Fallin' in and out of love
With you



Baby don't say no so quick
This ain't about me trying to see how far that I can get
But ain't gonna lie, wouldn't mind just a little bit of you and I
Eye to eye, lips on lips
Swaying to the music real close
We can both use a little let go kind of night

Baby, if you want a good time
We can get on it
Just take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor, we can dance on it, slow song it
As far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright night
That sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good, don't it?

Well I just now seen that smile
And I bet it's been a minute
Since you tapped on into that wild and crazy side
So baby, let's do this tonight
Baby, that moon looks just right
But don't fight it

If you want a good time we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor, we can dance on it, slow song it
As far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright night
That sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
It sounds pretty good, don't it?

So baby, let's get on it
You're gonna love it, you can bet on it
Karaoke, we can microphone it, whatever you want
As far as I can see that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright tonight
Sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
And it sounds pretty good now, don't it?
yeah, don't it (Hey hey, hey)
Get you feelin' alright girl
yeah, sounds pretty good, yeah don't it
yeah, don't it baby (hey hey, hey)
Oh yeah sounds pretty good now don't it



I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah



When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeah
Love is always comin', love is always goin'
No one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walkin' away

If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?
Oh, oh, oh

Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody



Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah, girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heeled shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that bar room door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots

A little dirty dancing
blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots



I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in the game I lost you
What a price to pay ooh
I'm cryin'
Ooh ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh baby baby
Mistakes, I know I've
Made a few, but I'm
Only human, you've made
Mistakes too I'm cryin'
Ooh ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm just about at the
End of my rope
But I can't stop cryin'
I can't give up hope
Because I feel someday
I'll hold you near
Whisper I still Love you
Until that day is here ooh
I'm cryin'
Ooh ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh



Yeah-eah!

I want a new drug
One that won't make me sick
One that won't make me crash my car
Or make me feel three feet thick

I want a new drug
One that won't hurt my head
One that won't make my mouth too dry
Or make my eyes too red

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you

I want a new drug
One that won't spill
One that don't cost too much
Or come in a pill

I want a new drug
One that won't go away
One that won't keep me up all night
One that won't make me sleep all day

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, baby

I want a new drug
One that does what it should
One that won't make me feel too bad
One that won't make me feel too good

I want a new drug
One with no doubt
One that won't make me talk too much
Or make my face freak out

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you



The smile, the charm, the words, the spark
Everything, you had it
Guess I had a naive heart
'Cause boy, I let you have it
You said I was your only
Never thought you'd leave me lonely

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan

Deep down, I knew that you
Were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me
Wanted to believe in you
Now it's happily ever never
I guess now I know better

You're just a lost boy
With your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy
Never keep your feet on the ground

Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan

Oh
Mm
You're just a lost boy
Yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy
Too busy chasing stars

And you're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
You're never gonna grow up
Yeah, you're never gonna be a man
Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man



What's your all time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you ask me, mine would be you

What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your ninety proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shining, back road flying
Singing like crazy fools
Making up our own words
Laughing 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever
My finest hour
my wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shining, back road flying
Singing like crazy fools
Making up our own words
Laughing 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever
My finest hour
my wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah you got it baby, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Taillights fading
Daylight breaking
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been running
Yellin' out something
To make you wanna hold onto
The best love ever
Girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you
Mine would be you



There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where my ends
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex
It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex
It's natural
It's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural - sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural - sex is fun
Sex is best when it's one on one on one
I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a love
C-c-c-c come on
What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love it 'til it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me
What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you call pornography
Don't you know I love it 'til it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me
Have sex with me
C-c-c-c come on



I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up, when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun, blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more,
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours
Hmm mm mm mm mm (hey, hey)

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A doo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, mmm hmm

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours

Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, whoa, baby, do you believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, mmm hmm



I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane

I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane



I don't remember, were we wild and young
All that faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don't know
Are we really who we used to be
Am I really who I was

The lights will draw you in
And the dark will bring you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you're lucky now

Waiting outside while you find your keys
Like bags of trash in the blackening snow
City of neon and toes that freeze
We've got nothing and nowhere to go
We've got nothing and nowhere

And the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
The night will break your heart
But only if you're lucky now

And if the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
But love will mend your heart
But only if you're lucky now

I don't remember were we wild and young
All that's faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don't know
Are we really who we used to be
Am I really who I was

(Derulo)

It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave yeah

In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high

Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, Baby I'm yours
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
So high

Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl you're the one I want to want me

Just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high

Anything and everything

Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the AstroTurf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiing?
Floatin' is all I wanna do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mm, motorboatin'

(Hoo hoo hoo)

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube

Pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mm, motorboatin'

(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)

Five mile an hour with aluminum side
Wood panelin' with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride

On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
I'm out here in the open
Mm, motorboatin'

On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)
On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)

Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon

(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)



Easy ready willing overtime
When does it stop, where do you dare me to draw the line
You got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it say No Go
Now I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do almost anything that you want me to
But I Can't Go For That
No Can Do
I can't go for being twice as nice
I can't go for just repeating the same old lines
Use the body now you want my soul
Ooh forget about it say No Go
Yeah I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do almost anything that you want me to
But I Can't Go For That
No Can Do.



Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't 21 yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits a hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't 21 yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits a hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need the house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a 20 dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'

'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits a hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more



Slip inside the eye of your mind,
Don't you know you might find, a better place to play.
You said that you'd never been,
But all the things that you've seen, will slowly fade away.
So I'll start a revolution from my bed,
'cause you said the brains I had went to my head.
Step outside, summertime's in bloom.
Stand up beside the fireplace,
take that look from off your face.
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.
And so, Sally can wait.
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.
Her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.
Take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows, if it's night or day.
But please don't put your life in the hands,
of a rock 'n' roll band, who'll throw it all away.
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed,
'cause you said the brains I had went to my head.
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom.
Stand up beside the fireplace,
take that look from off your face,
'cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out.
And so, Sally can wait.
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by.
My soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.
So, Sally can wait.
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.
Her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger, I heard you say.
So, Sally can wait.
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by.
My soul slides away
but don't look back in anger,
Don't look back in anger,
I heard you say.
At least not today.



You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' over backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you
Gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
Ever since I left the city



Like a rainy Sunday morning
makes me wanna stay in bed
twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
you take me places
put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses undercover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took on my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life
you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

Stealin' kisses undercover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You make it easy



Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl
And by the way you look, I understand
That you are not impressed
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress

I'm not gonna get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you are loving somebody
I only know it isn't mine

Alison
I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison
My aim is true

Well I see you got a husband now
Did you leave your pretty fingers
Lying in the wedding cake
You used to hold him right in your hand
I bet it took all he could take

Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

Alison
I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison
My aim is true

My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true
My aim is true



I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right

I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right

Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight

Common ruse dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone

Out from and far away
The wooden stake
This thing has got me on

Diamond rope silver chain
Pretty noose is a pretty pain

And I don't like What you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Common ruse dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate

And I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need
I don't want anything

And I don't like What you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like What you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
Yeah




Yeah
Oh now
She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair it just wasn't fair the way she was blowing my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane gets it's name from a girl like this
She's the cat five kind keeps you up at night hanging on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess, yeah the kind you love to love
But what happens next,
I got a feeling when the sun comes up
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels somewhere between going and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off, you give in and you just turn it on
She's a harp on a reign red lips like a flame, she's the girl from your favorite song
What a beautiful mess,
A one part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, or storm warning, yeah
A little heads up, little more time, little leap-way some kind of sign
Would have been nice
Some kind of radar system, if I heard it yeah I would have listened
To the storm, to the storm warning



Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise



Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind



I'd've skipped that party
Yeah, I never would've gone
If I could've seen the future
I would've just stayed home
You'd be a name I didn't know
In some idle conversation
With a laugh I never loved
And lips I never tasted

I don't wanna want you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna hate you
Or even care enough to
We struck out as lovers
We struck out as friends
Is it too much to ask
Can we be strangers
Again?

Sunny Sunday mornings
Yeah, they wouldn't hurt so bad
Songs about New Orleans
Wouldn't make me so damn sad
You wouldn't be that number
I've deleted seven times
Or that hammer in my chest
When someone orders Crown and Sprite

I don't wanna want you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna hate you
Or even care enough to
We struck out as lovers
We struck out as friends
Is it too much to ask
Can we be strangers?

You don't miss some place you've never been
Some face that you ain't ever met
No, you don't have to remember
What you ain't ever had to forget

I don't wanna want you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna hate you
Or even care enough to
We struck out as lovers
We struck out as friends
Is it too much to ask
Can we be strangers
Again?
Can we be strangers
Again?
Again?



I went down to Houston
And I stopped in San Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something
But I wasn't sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust

So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

I ain't never been to Vegas, but I gambled up my life
Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that some things never change

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

Up here in the city feels like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home
May you one day carry me home



I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time

'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

I'm four five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', how could I be so selfish?
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless?
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale

See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

four five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
That's all I want



Woo!

There's every good reason
for letting you go
She's sneaky and smoked out
And it's starting to show

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

I never let you turn around
your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
your back on each other

You say that I changed
Well maybe I did
But even if I changed
What's wrong with it?

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you turn around
your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
your back on each other

And all our friends are gone, are gone
And all the time moves on and on
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong

If there's a reason
It's lost on me
Maybe we'll be friends
I guess we'll see

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Turn around
your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
let's turn on each other
Good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
your back on each other
What a good idea

I remember the stupid things
The mood rings
the bracelets with the beads
Nickels and dimes
yours and mine
Did you cash in all your dreams?
You don't dream for me, no
You don't dream for me, no
But I still feel you pulsing like a sonar
From the days in the waves
That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to say
That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to say
She's like a sunburn
She's like a sunburn



Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain yeah
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words



I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind all this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
And suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you kiss meso sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose we never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songsjust to break my own fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall
All my friends say that of course it's gonna get better
Gonna get better
Better better better better
Better better better
I never love nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting by heart truly
I got lost In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Breaks my
Heart
Breaks my heart
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind all these words
I hear in my mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Breaks my
Heart
Breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart



Got a girl from the south side
got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
man, I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number
it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back
like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans
she don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no help
Got hips like honey
so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers
on them downtown streets

Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
headed south of her smile, mm
Get there when we get there
every inch is a mile

Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
Got braids in her hair



At first I was afraid,
I was petrified,
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side,
but then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
and I grew strong,
and I learned how to get along!

And so you're back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
if I had known for just one second,
you'd be back to bother me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
'cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself,
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high,
and you see me,
somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like dropping in,
and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
'cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
'cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive,
I will survive,
I will survive!



Last night, she said
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
See it turns me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen whole minutes now
And Baby, I feel so down
See I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

Yeah, People, they don't understand
No, Girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this I ain't never gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, Baby, don't feel so down
Oh it turns me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned around
Oh, Baby, I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left, that night

Oh people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, Baby, don't feel so down
See it turns me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned 'round
Oh baby I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah



Take a seat
right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
the cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, oh

Take a step
back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
and taps are still running
dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go, oh

Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection, oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle? Oh Yeah
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle? Oh
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle

Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she’s gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it’s a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan
You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day’s gone and the night’s on fire
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
She’s a seat laid back, a boy’s dream
Drawin’ hearts in the window steam
She’s a gettin’ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you’re headed to
What’s a red blooded boy to do
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire




Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby

Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch



One last drink to wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in

Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday
hey hey hey

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home



Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well I used to know a girl
And I could have sworn that
Her name was Veronica
Well she used to have
A carefree mind of her own and
A delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid
She's not even sure
If her name is Veronica
Do you suppose,
That waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs
At those who shout
Her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Did the days drag by?
Did the favors wane?
Did he roam down the town
All the time?
Will you wake from your dream,
With a wolf at the door,
Reaching out for Veronica
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street
Where she lived
And a young man sailed on
A ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica
On the "Empress of India"And as she closed her eyes
Upon the world and
Picked upon the bones
Of last week's news
She spoke his name out loud again
Do you suppose,
That waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs
At those who shout
Her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Veronica sits in her favorite chair and
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name
That they never get right and
If they don't then nobody else will
But she used to have
A carefree mind of her own,
With devilish look in her eye
Saying "You can call me
Anything you like,
But my name is Veronica"Do you suppose,
That waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs
At those who shout
Her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica



Here is my song for the asking
Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile

This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away
I've been waiting all my life

Thinking it over
I've been sad
Thinking it over
I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking

Ask me I will play
All the love that I hold inside



I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing will
Drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Just for one day

And you
You can be mean
And I
I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers
And that is a fact
Yes we're lovers
And that is that

Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
For ever and ever
What d'you say

I
I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We can beat them
For ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes
Just for one day

I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be us
Just for one day

I
I can remember
Standing
By the wall
And the guns
Shot above our heads
And we kissed
As though nothing could fall
And the shame
Was on the other side
Oh we can beat them
For ever and ever
Then we can be Heroes
Just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
We're nothing
And nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one day



Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that
There was a little more to life somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
she had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (make it last all night)
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on the balcony
And she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her good memory
God, it's so painful when something that's so close
That is still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (make it last all night)
She was an American girl



Oh the night, here it comes again
It's on with the jeans, the jacket and a shirt
How'd I end up feeling so bad
For such a little girl

And I hold you close in the back of my mind
Feels so good but damn it makes me hurt
And I'm too scared to know how I feel about you now
La Cienega just smiled, "see you around"

And I hold you close in the back of my mind
Raise my glass 'cause either way I'm dead
Neither of you really help me to sleep anymore
One breaks my body and the other breaks my soul
La Cienega just smiles, waves goodbye

Oh the night, here it comes again
It's off with the jeans, the jacket and the shirt
How'd I end up feeling so bad
For such a little girl

And I hold you close in the back of my mind
Feels so good but damn it makes me hurt
I'm too scared to know how I feel about you now
How I feel about you now
La Cienega just smiles and says, "I'll see you around"



I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go



What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind



Says she's had enough of me
I've had enough of her too
I might as well go on and set her free
she's already turned me loose

no fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong
That's just the way it sometimes goes
Sometimes two people just don't get along
and it's time to hit the road

Goodbye, farewell, so long, vaya con dios
Good luck, wish you well, take it slow
Easy come girl, easy go

We tried to work it out a hundred times
Ninety-nine it didn't work
I think it's best we put it all behind
before we wind up getting hurt

No hard feelings darling, no regrets
No tears and no broken hearts
Call it quits, calling off all bets
It just wasn't in the cards

Goodbye, farewell, so long, vaya con dios
Good luck, wish you well, take it slow
Easy come girl, easy go

Easy come girl, easy go
Vaya con dios, good luck,
Easy come, easy go



First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache, from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

(Pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain)
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain)
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
(Pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like

(Pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain)
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
(Pain)
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer



Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
Make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me

Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light

I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light

May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line

Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight



I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine
But Mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again?
Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength, yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait?
How much more can I take?
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember Mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
No, love, love, don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting, I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy
But Mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take



Eight o'clock on Friday night
I'm still at home
All my girls just keep blowing up my phone
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I'll let him down easy

'Cause tonight is all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

I'm feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot
Hey bartender

What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Hey bartender



I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
'Til my sins wash away

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church

Hey, can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church

But I forgive you, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)



I never win first place
I don't support the team
I can't take direction
And my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me
My parents hated me
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothing right
Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
Can't take the person staring back at me
I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
I wanna be somebody else
L.A. told me
You'll be a pop star
All you have to change
Is everything you are
Tired to be compared
To damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty
That just ain't me
So, doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe something
A day in the life of someone else?
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
Its bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
Doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe something
A day in the life of someone else?
Don't let me get me
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
Its bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else



Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Ok, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him

I know, you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look
Just tell him, it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends

Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you're so done with him
Break up with him
break up with him

You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever
Just do what you gotta do, but if I was you

I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
It's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him



Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time

If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Oh Oh Oh
For the longest time
Oh Oh Oh
For the longest time
Oh Oh Oh
For the longest time



I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again

You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' hearts still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad

I don't know
And I can't let it go
Yeah it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' hearts still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to?

Is it a feel good song gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on pass to pass
Or the kind you can't help singing along
Singing whoa

Is it headphones on on a downtown train
Or a window seat on an outbound plane
Is it L.A. sunny or Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' hearts still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

I put that record on
girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again




Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire




We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won
as we sailed into the mystic

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows
I will be coming home
And when that fog horn blows
I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
Then magnificently we will float
into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows
you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows
I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will float
into the mystic

Come on girl...



Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's somethin' I just have to say
I don't think I could hide
What I'm feelin' inside
Another day
Knowin' I love you

And I I'm getting' too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I tell you tonight
Will you turn out the light
And walk away
Knowin' I love you?

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda
I love you

And, I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free
Are you ready for me
To feel this way?
I don't wanna lose ya

So it may be too soon I know
The feelin' takes so long to grow
If I tell you today
Will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't wanna lose you

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda
Oh girl

You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl
we can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late
Oh oh oh oh oh

And feelin' the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you



Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why why (That way) Why why

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, ooh tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooh tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooh tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why



Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name



You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me, go
Yeah, go, but remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe, when I found you

You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turned your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way, then go
Yeah, go, but remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe, when I found you

Yeah, go, just go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe, when I found you



Lookin' in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Standin' here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart
That I'm feelin' for you

Let 'em say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand
Baby, don't ever look back

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Oh, whoa

I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you

Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes
Is what I'm gonna do

Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever ever and ever, hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

World runs out of lovers
Nothing's gonna stop us
We'll still have each other

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Friday night and I need a fight
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those

Girls, Girls, Girls
Long legs and burgundy lips
Girls, Girls, Girls
Dancin' down on Sunset Strip
Girls, Girls, Girls
Red lips, fingertips

Trick or treat
sweet to eat
On Halloween and New Year's Eve
Yankee girls ya just can't beat
But they're the best when they're off their feet

Girls, Girls, Girls
At the Dollhouse in Ft. Lauderdale
Girls, Girls. Girls
Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletails
Girls, Girls, Girls
Raising Hell at the seventh Veil

Have you read the news
In the Soho Tribune
Ya know she did me
Well then she broke my heart
I'm such a good good boy
I just need a new toy
I tell ya what, girl
Dance for me, I'll keep you over-employed
Just tell me a story
You know the one I mean

Crazy Horse, Paris, France
Forget the names, remember romance
I got the photos, a menage a trois
Musta broke those Frenchies laws with those

Girls, Girls, Girls
Body Shop in the Marble Arch
Girls, Girls, Girls
Tropicana's where I lost my heart
Girls, Girls, Girls

Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, Girls, Girls
Girls, Girls, Girls



I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in a bar
'Cause I'm always your last call

I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
"Baby, I still love you"
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in bar
'Cause I'm always your last

Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call

I bet you're in a bar
It's always the same old song
That Johnny Walker Red
By now it's almost gone
But baby, I won't be there
To catch you when you fall
I bet you're in bar
'Cause I'm always your last call



One, two
One, two, three

Wake up kids
We've got the dreamers disease
Age fourteen we got you down on your knees
So polite, you're busy still saying please

Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smash their Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh 'til we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home baby
You're tops,
Give it to me now

Four a.m. we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke,
But hey we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

This whole damn world
could fall apart
You'll be ok
follow your heart
You're in harms way
I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give
Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Don't let go

Fly high
What's real, can't die
You only get what you give
You are gonna get what you give
Don't give up
Just don't be afraid to leave
Health insurance rip off lying FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around
We'll kick your ass in
Don't let go
One dance left
Don't give up
Can't forget




"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together"
"I've got some real estate here in my bag"
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America

"Kathy" I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
"Michigan seems like a dream to me now"
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've come to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said "Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera"

"Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat"
"We smoked the last one an hour ago"
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

"Kathy, I'm lost" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America



I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you
Could be so ok now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you
Could be so ok, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the
Traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you
Could be so ok, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street



Ooh

There's a four by six
of a sunset kiss
And one of you laughin' at me
catching my first fish
One on Valentine's Day
With the mariachi band
at our favorite place

Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happenin'
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

There's one on my phone (one on my phone)
that I can't erase
But you'd never know
by the smile on my face
That inside I was dying
later that night I'd be crying
The last one before "goodbye"

Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

Ooh
No photo evidence
not a single proof
Of all the hell that we went through

But damn, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
Oh, yes we did
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
(So happy)
(So happy in pictures)




Sunset sings the sweetest tune
Just the song he wrote for his true love the moon
I held you dear since the dawn of time
You know it's true that for you I shine

Going up, you're coming down
I'm only hoping some day you'll turn around
'Cause I'd be shining and then you'll see
Who could love you more than me?

How I wish you felt the same
I'm jealous of the wolves when they howl out your name
I send my love bouncing from star to star
So it can find you wherever you are

I'm going up, you're coming down
I'm only hoping some day you'll turn around
'Cause I'd be shining and then you'll see
Who could love you more than me?
Ah who could love you more than me
No one could love you more than me



Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't



Don't you know I got to find me a home
Right now in your heart

I'll travel over miles and down the highways, babe
Through the valleys every byway
Just to find me a home right now in your heart

I'll bring you to the music, refueling
Everything you want to
Everything you need babe

Gotta find me a home

Somewhere in your heart




Nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home

It's been a long night here
and a long night there
And these long, long legs
are damn near everywhere
Hold up now, you look good
I will not lie
But if you ask

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all my love

So nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home

and to another I will stay true

I will stay true

Now better men than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
Now check it out, I've got her
and she got me
And you've got that ass
but I kindly gotta be like

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all my love

So nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home
and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey I'm good

Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
Just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same



It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore younger man's clothes"

La la la, dee dee da
La la, dee dee da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As a smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Oh, la la la, dee dee da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davie who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As a businessman slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

Oh, la la la, dee dee da
La la, dee dee da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright



Pretty little hairdo
don't do what it used to
Can't disguise the living
All the miles that you've been through

Looking like a train wreck
Wearing too much makeup
The burden that you carry
Is more than one soul could ever bear

Don't look so sad, Marina
There's another part to play
Don't look so sad, Marina
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

You never make your mind up
Like driving with your eyes shut
Rough around the edges
Won't someone come and take you home

Waiting for a breakthrough
What will you set your mind to?
We stood outside the Chinese restaurant
In the rain

Don't look so sad, Marina
There's another part to play
Don't look so sad, Marina
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day



Trailer for sale or rent
rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but, two hours of pushin' broom buys a
Eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means
king of the road

Third boxcar midnight train
destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union dues

I smoke old stogies I have found
short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means
king of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no-one's around
I sing

Trailers for sale or rent
rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but, two hours of pushin' broom buys a

You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'

Once upon a time
Not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk, so tough
It's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night Tommy whispers
Baby it's ok, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer



Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go

Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town
Like the old town
Even when the miles are many
I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me
Like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field

My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright

And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
And it keeps me turning home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night

And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made
and prayin' I got it right

Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah



Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm countin' the days (ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty five (ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killin' the game (ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playin' our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're makin' it worse
'Cause you're so hot, it's hurtin' my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal

Before the X-rated dreamin' (ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast to coast life (ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the hustle (ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playin' our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're makin' it worse
'Cause you're so hot, it's hurtin' my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal

Show me the banana (na na na na na)
Show me the banana (na na na)
Show me the banana (na na na na na)
Show me the banana (na na na)

And I'm out at a party, they're playin' our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're makin' it worse
'Cause you're so hot, it's hurtin' my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
(only one who knows me, babe)
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal (woo)
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal (woo)
So hot, you're hurtin' my feelings (woo)
Can't deal



I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
It's more than a feeling, more than a feeling
when I hear that old song they used to play
(more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)'til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander onas clear as the sun in the summer sky
It's more than a feeling, (more than a feeling)
when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)'til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away.
It's more than a feeling, (more than a feeling)
when I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'til I see Marianne walk away...



Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life



I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly reknown
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Livin' by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were gettin' our share
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime

And oh the wonder
We felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I awoke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in



Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make up
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne (You don't have to put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (You don't have to put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)
Roxanne (Put on the red light)



Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something goin' on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love we feel needs no conversation
And we ride it together, uh huh,
Making love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you've got no one
And you just walk in the the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Sail away
Oh, sail away with me

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
Islands in the stream, that is what we are



You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who has further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium, I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard, thus bulletproof glass

You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
I am titanium



All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
The tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
Mad World
Mad World
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And they feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello teacher tell me whats my lesson
Look right through me
Look right through me
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
Mad World
Mad World
Enlarge your world
Mad World



All the broken hearts in the world still beat
Let's not make it harder than it has to be
Oh it's all the same thing
Girls chase boys chase girls

This tattered document
A mystery you can solve
Some burnt out filament
Flies buzzing around the bulb

Country darkness

He thought of traveling
Heard an approaching train
Drown out his desperate pulse
A song with no refrain

Country darkness

She daydreams of forbidden sins
There must be something more
The prison she lives in
The one with the open door

Country darkness

The veil is covering
A glistening and cruel blade
Suffer little children
Repent, unfaithful maid

Country darkness



I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, ok I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, ok I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between
Well, ok we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad



Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
You made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better reason to write you a love song today
I learned the hard way
That they all say things you want to hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better reason to write you a love song today
Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone
'cause I believe there's a way you can love me because I say
I won't write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that there's a reason to
Write you a love song today




I heard, that you're
settled down that you
found a girl and you're
married now
I heard, that your
dreams came true
guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend
why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too
don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the
time flies only
yesterday was the
time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg
I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares
no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
their memories made
Who would have known how
bittersweet this would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead



One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
But they don't know, what they don't know

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just 'cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Last call gets later and later
I come in here, so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old, same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just 'cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution



You're not the type
Type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy too shy
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees
With his hands clenched tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse and for better
But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
In the past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart
Who are you, you, you
I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start
And it seems that every time
We're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you
That I don't wanna lose
And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
And it's never easy
Darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
But when I think of, life without us
She's like "what we supposed to do?"
But I don't wanna come on too strong
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
We can live like this forever
It's fine by me
It's fine by me if you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me




A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, Baby it's good to me
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms have come and gone
Leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray, all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo the many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope
Is for the folk who can't cope with such an enduring pain
That it keeps them in the pouring rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast



Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me



Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love



There's somethin' happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A-tellin' me I've got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin' down

There's battle lines bein' drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speakin' their minds
A-gettin' so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin' down

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin' down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin'
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin'
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin'
You better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin'



Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
ever since she left
Before you punch that number
could I make one request

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
play me a country song

now I ain't got nothin'
against rock 'n' roll
But when your heart's been broken
you need a song that's slow
Ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
to drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
play a song for me

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
play me a country song
Yeah don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song



Wait in line
'Till your time
Ticking clock
Everyone stop

Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me

Whoa
Do you believe
In what you see
There doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me

Do you believe
In what you see
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe in
What you see

Nine to five
Living lies
Everyday
Stealing time
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can

Whoa
Do you believe
In what you feel
It doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me

Do you believe
In what you see
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see

Ah and I'll shout and I'll scream
But I'd rather not have seen
And I'll hide away for another day

Do you believe
In what you see
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see

Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Different things to me
Different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can




I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcée in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues



Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
My doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day
'Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself




I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not going to fade
As soon as you close your eyes and you know it
And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
well can you feel it?
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know



All through the night
I'll be awake
And I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time
When time is new

Oh
All through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same
Without saying

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten
What binding they lack

Oh
Under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

Oh
The sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there a while

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star
get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star
get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star
get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star
get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold




Last time I was here, it was rainin'
It ain't raining anymore
The streets were drowned, and the water's waning
All the runes washed to shore
Now I'm here lookin' through the rubble
Tryin' to find out who we were
Last time I was here, it was rainin'
Ain't rainin' anymore

Last time I was here, you were waitin'
You're not waitin' anymore
The window's broke and the smoke's escapin'
The books scattered across the floor
And the church bells are ringin' through the sirens
And your coat was full of bullet holes
Last time I was here, you were waitin'
You're not waitin' anymore

So, may the wind blow, may the moonlight know your name
So, let the needle move the record 'round
'Til the walls cave in
And you and I are out there dancin' in the dirty rain

Last time I was here, it was rainin'
Like you've never seen it rain
And your eyes were filled with
Terror and smoke from the gasoline
As the stars exploded with gunfire
I saw you smilin' just before
Last night I was here, you were cryin'
You ain't cryin' anymore

So, may the wind blow, may the moonlight know your name
So, let the needle move the record 'round
'Til the walls cave in and you and I are out there
Dancin' in the dirty rain

Ooh in the dirty rain
Mmm in the dirty rain
In the dirty rain



Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries,It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You... you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You... you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
What's the use of trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
Not if I tried, no
'Cause I'm a believer
Yes I'm a believer



This ain't a twenty minute town no more
It don't look the same
Red lights, bars, streets, too much concrete
I don't recognize a thing

Ain't a twenty minute call no more
No, you don't call me at all
Outside, a rain falls, curtains half drawn
I'm here, talking to the walls

All the time and the whiskey I've wasted
That I ain't ever getting back
And I've tried to find the courage just to face it
But I can't, I can't
And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger
Over and over again
Oh, when everything around me keeps changing
But I can't, I can't, I can't

If feels impossible to move sometimes
Like you're still in the room
Smoke on my breath, chains on my chest
Damn, you won't cut me loose
I just gotta get out of here (I gotta get out of here)
Get up off the floor
Find my senses 'cause you meant it
You're not coming back no more

All the time and the whiskey I've wasted
That I ain't ever getting back
Oh, I've tried to find the courage just to face it
But I can't, I can't
And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger
Over and over again
Oh, when everything around me keeps changing
But I can't (I can't), I can't (I can't), I can't
Oh, I can't, I can't

All the time and the whiskey I've wasted
That I ain't ever getting back
I've tried to find the courage just to face it
But I can't, I can't
And I'm tired of you feeling like a stranger
Over and over again (over and over again)
Oh, when everything around me keeps changing
But I can't (I can't), I can't (I can't), I can't

(As hard as I try, as hard as I try)
I can't, I can't
(As hard as I try, as hard as I try)
I can't, I can't, I can't
Oh (As hard as I try, as hard as I try) I can't
I can't
(As hard as I try, as hard as I try)



I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in the fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the Kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running

You broke the bonds
and you loosened chains
carried the cross of my shame
of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for



I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy
Just because she can

Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Heaven help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds
before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
but I keep livin' this day
like the next will never come

Oh help me, but don't tell me
to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself
of all these lies that I'm good
enough for him
I got a lot to lose and I'm
bettin' high
so I'm beggin' you before it ends
just tell me where to begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Let me know the way
before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
to make my lover stay
So what would an angel say
the devil wants to know

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love



When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So kiss me, my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart



You know I can be found,
sitting home all alone,
If you can't come around,
at least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
for something I might have said,
Please, let's forget the past,
the future looks bright ahead,
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't stop thinking of me,
don't make me feel this way,
Come on over here and love me,
you know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart

Let's walk up to the preacher
and let us say I do,
Then you'll know you'll have me,
and I'll know that I'll have you,
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of




Well, I heard some people talking just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
Well, let me tell you I've got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

'Cause I'm already gone
and I'm feeling strong
I will sing this victory song
woo ooh ooh, my my
woo ooh ooh

The letter that you wrote me
made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this my girl
when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right

And I'm already gone
and I'm feeling strong
I will sing this victory song
woo ooh ooh, my my
woo ooh ooh

Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So oftentimes it happens
that we live our lives in chains
That we never even know we have the key

Me, I'm already gone
and I'm feeling strong
I will sing this victory song
'cause I'm already gone

'Cause I'm already gone
and I'm feeling strong
I will sing this victory song
'cause I'm already gone

Yes, I'm already gone
already gone (alright, nighty night)
Already gone
already gone



Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow. "

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do



All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

Say it ain't so, I will not go (na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Turn the lights off, carry me home (na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill (na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
The night will go on (na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
The night will go on (na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
My little windmill



Ooh!
Oh yeah!
Ah huh!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
(Uh oh!)

Panama
Panama, ow!
Panama
Panama, oh oh oh oh
Woo!

Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off, you know what I'm sayin'
Ah, reach down between my legs and ease the seat back

She's runnin', I'm flyin'
Right behind in the rearview mirror now
Got the fearin', power steerin'
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin' now

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama, oh oh oh oh
Panama
Panama, oh oh oh oh

Panama!



It's a God awful small affair
To the girl with the mousey hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is no where to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seats with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors
Fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man!
Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors
Fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man!
Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?



Do you love the rain? Does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)

Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life

I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, want the good and the bad everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh, yeah

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (sweet heart of yours)
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life

I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah
And I
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance?
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain



Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine,
love is so confusing there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah

Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

Once I had a love and it was gas
Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind



Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You're just livin'
Like kerosene dancin' around a fire
But you're in it

So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth livin' for
In a old dusty hand me down six string
And a couple chords

I'm gettin' over her
A little more with every song
So y'all sing along

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

Whoa, whoa

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
'Cause she got the best of me
She got the best of me




Know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed
yeah, ooh

that's why I am easy
I'm easy like sunday morning yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it
No, ooh

that's why I am easy
I'm easy like sunday morning yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning

I wanna be high
so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me
Whoa, oh Babe

ooh

That's why I am easy
I'm easy like sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like sunday morning
whoa

'cause I'm easy
easy like sunday morning, yeah
'cause I'm easy
easy like sunday morning



We'll do it all
Everything
On our own

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?



A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin'
bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from james dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book of Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singing
bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance!
'cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singing
bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing
bye-bye, miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singing
bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die

They were singing
bye-bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die



Oh

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh yeah
And they're gone so fast, yeah

Oh so hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
And when you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care?

She's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waiting, waiting around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplyin' her lipstick
The muddy riverbank she's the first in, and the last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talkin' 'bout
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got
Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love
'Cause she got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
Yeah, I want whatever she's got
She's got me hangin' on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got
She's a little bit complicated
That's alright
Doesn't matter I'll keep on waiting
For whatever she's got
For whatever she's got



I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial
doing anything my radio advised
with every one of those late night stations
playing songs bringing tears to me eyes
I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver
when the switch broke 'cause it's old
They're saying things that I can hardly believe.
They really think we're getting out of control.
Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice
'cause they think that it's treason.
So you had better do as you are told.
You better listen to the radio.
I wanna bite the hand that feeds me.
I wanna bite that hand so badly.
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me.
Some of my friends sit around every evening
and they worry about the times ahead
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
and the promise of an early bed
You either shut up or get cut out;
they don't wanna hear about it.
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel.
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools
tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel
Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice
'cause they think that it's treason.
So you had better do as you are told.
You better listen to the radio.
Wonderful radio
Marvelous radio
Wonderful radio



Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance with me baby
Don't ya wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance

Well this heart of mine
Has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time
To get back what it gone
But I'm movin' on
And you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
When I would curse your name
Yeah

Well I heard the news
That you were back in town
Just passin' through
To claim your lost and found
But I'm over you
And there ain't nothin' that
You could say or do
To take what you did back
Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

Well I've been doin' fine without you
Forgettin' all the love we once knew
And girl I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed you thinkin'
But I ain't got a heart for breakin'
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
'Cause love don't live here anymore

Well honey you can try
To tell me how it is
And try to justify
Everything you did
But honey I'm no fool
And I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go
Well I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

Well I've been doin' fine without you
Forgettin' all the love we once knew
And girl I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinkin'
But I ain't got a heart for breakin'
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
'Cause love don't live here anymore

Oh no
Sugar no
And you don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here girl
Oh love don't live here anymore



Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm-a getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I sure would like to see you one more time

It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
Maybe it's all wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl, it's something I can do, girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on
Moving on, oh



Life springs eternal
On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all
I spent the best part of my losing streak
In an Army Jeep
For what I can't recall

Oh I'm banging on my TV set
And I check the odds
And I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blinds
And I wonder what I'll find

I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

Used to be I could drive up to
Barstow for the night
Find some crossroad trucker
To demonstrate his might
But these days it seems
Nowhere is far enough away
So I'm leaving Las Vegas today

I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

I'm standing in the middle of the desert
Waiting for my ship to come in
But now no joker, no jack, no king
Can take this loser hand
And make it win

I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

I quit my job as a dancer
At the Lido des Girls
Dealing blackjack until one or two
Such a muddy line between
The things you want
And the things you have to do

I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving Las Vegas

And I won't be back
No I won't be back
Not this time



one, two, three: uh!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
'Cause we don't know how
Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya!
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it'Til there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why oh, why oh why oh
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away




I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say I was taking it hard
Oh, she wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Well, the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love
never once suspectin'
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each mornin'
And finding that you're gone from me
There's aches and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
I came up in second place

Well, the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all



Got a wife and kids in baltimore, jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart



I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I love you more with every breath, truly madly deeply do
I will be strong, I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on

A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of

The highest power
in lonely hours
the tears devour you

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath, truly madly deeply do

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me




After all you put me through
You'd think I despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you make me that much stronger

When I, thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff, time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were, there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your, joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out of shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in
On a good thing before I realized your game
I heard you're going round
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin
Feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Yes you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore
No more, oh no, it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I
I ain't goin' stop
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
But I remember
So I remember
I'll remember

Thought I would forget
But I remember
So I remember
I'll remember

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter



You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone gone gone woah

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something in you is dying

You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone gone gone woah

Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love a love a love you don't find everyday
So don't don't don't don't let it slip away
Baby baby, baby baby, I beg of you please please please please
I need your love (I need your love),
I need your love (I need your love),
So bring it on back (So bring it on back),
Bring it on back (so bring it on back)

Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone gone gone,
and I can't go on, no

Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone gone gone



I don't want to be the kind to hesitate,
Be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do,
I just want to dance with you.
I gotta feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine.
If we have a chance to make one heart of two,
I just want to dance with you.
I want to dance with you,twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancin' for,
I just want to dance with you.
I want to dance with you,hold you in my arms once more,
That's what they invented dancin' for,
I just want to dance with you.
I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you,
Yes I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do,
I just want to dance with you.
Oh the boys are playin' softly and the girls are too,
So am I and so are you.
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue,
I just want to dance with you.
I want to dance with you,twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancin' for,
I just want to dance with you.
I want to dance with you,hold you in my arms once more,
That's what they invented dancin' for,
I just want to dance with you.
I just want to dance with you,
I just want to dance with you,



I don't want to go out
I won't stay in
Get things done

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern love - walks beside me
Modern love - walks on by
Modern love - gets me to the church on time
Church on time - terrifies me
Church on time - makes me party
Church on time - puts my trust in god and man
God and man - no confessions
God and man - no religion
God and man - don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern love - walks beside me
Modern love - walks on by
Modern love - gets me to the church on time
Church on time - terrifies me
Church on time - makes me party
Church on time - puts my trust in god and man
God and man - no confessions
God and man - no religion
God and man - don't believe in modern love

Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love
Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love

Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by

Never gonna fall for
Never gonna fall for



Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, Sonny, move out to the country
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack (ack)
You oughta know by now (oughta know)

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
An watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
An watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend, until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to

Sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah



Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son,
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin 'til the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never neverland

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never neverland

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never neverland



Won't you scratch my itch, sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town?
Come out on your porch, step into your parlor
And I'll tell you how it all went down

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh, and I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you

'Cause I headed west to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet
from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge
Last night at half past two
Switchman wave his lantern goodbye and good day
As we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
Now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
That I've never been shown
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring, I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
Talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you



Messing with my pride, thinking anytime
You could just get up and go
Then I realize what the hell is love
If you're in complete control?

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Sucked up by a wave, shot to outer space
Spend it but I'm not alone

Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue

Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, right through your lens
Show me what I need to see

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Ever losing lanes, battle ships and planes
Push me out, away we go

Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue

Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home

Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue



Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all the tale
He fell in love with a Gun Street Girl and
Now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail
Dancing in the Birmingham jail

Took a one hundred dollars off a slaughterhouse Joe
Brought a bran' new michigan twenty gauge
Got all liquored up on that road house corn,
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette

Bought a second hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese
Dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past four
Well he left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door

I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home

Sitting in a sycamore in Saint John's Wood
Soakin' day old bread in kerosene
He was blue as a robin's egg brown as a hog
Stayin' out of circulation 'til the dogs get tired
Stayin' out of circulation 'til the dogs get tired

Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull whipped dog
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way

Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof
And the Burlinton Northern's pullin' out of the world
With a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw
And a Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all
A Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all

Riding in the shadow by the Saint Joe Ridge
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane
Pullin' into Baker on a New Year's Eve
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door

Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row
And he smuggled in a bran' new pair of alligator shoes.
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair, well
They tired her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
They tired her to a tree with a skinny millionaire

I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home

Bangin' on a table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again,
I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again



She left Dallas for California
With an old friend at her side
Well he did not say much
But one year later
He'd ask her to be his wife

And the lights of L.A. County
They look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side

One year later I left Houston
With an old friend at my side
Well it did not say much
But it was a beauty
Of a coal black .45

And the lights of L.A. County
They look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side

So I drove on all the day long
And I drove on through the night
And I thought of her a'waiting
For to be his blushing bride

And the lights of L.A. County
They looked like diamonds in the sky
As I drove into the valley
With my old friend at my side

And as she stood there at the altar
All dressed in her gown of white
Lord her face was bright as the stars a-shining
Like I'd dreamed of all my life

And they kissed each other
And they turned around
And they saw me standing in the aisle
Well I did not say much
I just stood there watching
As that .45 told them goodbye

And the lights of L.A. County
Look like diamonds in the sky
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your side

And the lights of L.A. County
Are a mighty pretty sight
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your side



I like to dream
Yes, yes right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sight I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
to the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
on a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
fantasy will set you free.

Close your eyes girl,
look inside girl,
let the sound take you away.

Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
and so I wished that I could stay.
Before the thing could answer me
well someone took the lamp away
I looked around
a lousy candle was all I found.

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
fantasy will set you free.

Close your eyes girl,
look inside girl,
let the sound take you away.



There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
Hey

I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

It's kinda funny how I can't seem to get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good, it's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been draggin' your feet

Ain't it funny how I can't seem to get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good, it's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good, it's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget
Oh honey, I'm fallin' apart
You're playin' hard to forget



If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh (oh-oh)

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls



Ah, yeah, ah, yeah

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it

Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it

Room on lock, the way we rock it

Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Can't stop the feelin'
Got this feelin' in my body, come on (ooh)




I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world



I know they say you can't go home again
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine

Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know, under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From Better Homes and Garden magazine
Plans were drawn, and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this old world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that, built me



I may never like your shoes
You may never like mine
We may never be all cheers drinkin' beers
Arm in arm singin' Auld Lang Syne
But maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle
Like strings 'tween a fiddle and a bow
You need a paddle on the left, a paddle on the right
'Cause we're all in the same damn boat

Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere
It's a bad seed to sow, it's a dead end road when you go there
Makin' any headway that way ain't got no prayer, no prayer
Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere

We're all going somewhere
When we ain't here no more
We're all going somewhere
And we're all going through the same door

Now wakin' up and puttin' that smile on
Beats the hell out of wakin' up dead
That ain't how grandpa always was
But it is what he always said, now
Stick a stubborn hillbilly in the middle of the city
Gotta learn how not to throw stones
He didn't live long enough to hear this song
But he lived long enough to know, no, no

Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere
It's a bad seed to sow, it's a dead end road when you go there
Makin' any headway that way ain't got no prayer, no prayer
Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere
No, no, nowhere

Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere
It's a bad seed to sow, it's a dead end road when you go there
Makin' any headway that way ain't got no prayer, no prayer
Hatin' somebody ain't never got nobody nowhere

We're all going somewhere
When we ain't here no more
We're all going somewhere
And we're all going through the same door
We're all going somewhere
When we ain't here no more
We're all going somewhere
And we're all going through the same door



You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
And they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue

Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

Innocence, your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you



Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning



Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself
Longin' for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?A
in't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow
In the shallow
In the shallow
We're far from the shallow now



I met her in a club down in old Soho where you
Drink champagne and it tastes just like coca-cola
C-O-L-A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said
Lola L-O-L-A Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candle light
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said "Dear boy won't you come home with me?"

Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man"

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am in the bed, I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola lo lo lo lo Lola



Almost midnight
Another one drives by
Sounds like a V8
Listen to it fade away
It ain't her, that's for sure
Just another night of
Watchin' headlights all night
Movin' cross the ceiling, prayin'
Slow down, turn now
I wish I was sleepin'
Instead of wonderin' where you are
Wide awake, countin' cars
There's nothin' like the sound
Of her wheels rollin' down
This old gravel driveway
Like she's done everyday
Comin' home girl, come on
I'm here goin' crazy
Watchin' headlights all night
Movin' 'cross the ceiling, prayin'
Slow down, turn now
I wish I was sleepin'
Instead of wonderin' where you are
Wide awake, countin' cars
I wonder if she's drivin' by
Goin' 'round and 'round in circles
Wide awake
Watchin' headlights all night
Movin' 'cross the ceiling, prayin'
Slow down, turn now
I wish I was sleepin'
Instead of wonderin' where you are
Wide awake, countin' cars
Oh, countin' cars
Countin' cars



There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

Mm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do

But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now and, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together



I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me, "Goodbye"
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

It takes one hand to count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man, that ain't ever let me down

Longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart

She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red tail lights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

But longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart

Well, it takes one hand to count the things I can count on
But I got one hand that's gripping down on a cold one

'Cause longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart




(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)

Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen.
I guess if you said so
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)

(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)

Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(you ain't got no money and you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)

(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)
Well
(don't you come back no more.)
Uh, what you say?
(don't you come back no more.)
I didn't understand you
(don't you come back no more.)
You can't mean that
(don't you come back no more.)
Oh, now baby, please
(don't you come back no more.)
What you tryin' to do to me?
(don't you come back no more.)
Oh, don't treat me like that
(don't you come back no more.)



Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause, I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
Whoa oh whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now ooh ooh



Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Ah, ah

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily



Rearview crosses
Railroad ties
Oh, Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God, I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along
without thinkin' 'bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through
without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along
without thinkin' 'bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through
without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along
without thinkin' 'bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through
without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin' shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I miss you baby, I miss you baby, ooh
I'm on in
Still with you, baby
I can feel your heartbeat, baby



Well, all the parties on the streets are talking
store front mannequins sleeping in lights
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking
like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew The bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on a laid back kind of style
But boy you know it's been a while

I don't know why you don't take me downtown
like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh anymore

I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that 'll show a little uh uh
But you ain't getting uh oh if you don't come pick me up (damn)
Show me off (wow)
you might be tired but I'm not

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

I don't know why you don't take me down town
like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh anymore

Yeah don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it




Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away, away
Yes, you're one number away



I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby

Let your love come down
Oh, get it on

C'mon, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified
Girl, you give me good feeling
I've been sanctified



When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry.
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special,
You're so fucking special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I wanna have control.
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out again,
She's running,
She run, run, run, run, run.

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special,

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here.



She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring
and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything
can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yeah

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooh there's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime
And American honey
And American honey



Uh huh, it's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye
Baby even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you you you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you you you
Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you you you
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you you you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you you you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you you you
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
It's Iggy Iggz, uh
What you got?
Smart money bettin', I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems
But you won't be one
Like what!
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem




And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am




I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage
Heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
And took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
Oh, I'm just a ghost in this house



Son, she said, have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was nothin' but a...
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'

sorry you didn't see him
but I'm glad we talked

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said I'm ready for you
I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look, the look

Oh, you know where
now I can't see
I just stare

I, I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh

Is something wrong, she said
Well of course there is
You're still alive, she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be
Is that the question
And if so if so
who answers who answers

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
yeah I, ooh, I'm still alive
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah



The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset,
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer,
But my favorite color is

Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
the light at this end of the tunnel is neon

The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime for people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted
That's why they invented

Neon, the light they always leave on
The weekend on the rocks
An old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
the light this end of the tunnel is always neon

You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer,
But my favorite color is

Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
This end of the tunnel is neon



You can tell the world
you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends
just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone

You can tell my arms
to go back on to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips
to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooh

You can tell your ma
I moved to Arkansas
Or you can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff
who's fist can tell my lips
He never really liked me anyway

Oh tell your Aunt Louise
tell anything you please
Myself I'm ready
No I'm not ok
Or you can tell my eye
to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me one day

But don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooh

Don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooh

Don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooh
Oh!



Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the southland
I miss ol' 'bamy once again and I think it's a sin

Well I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well I heard ole Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor, boo hoo hoo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you, tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you, here I come

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes they do)
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama, oh sweet home
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you



When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I've seen you it is on (I want you back)
Oh I do now (I want you back)
Ooh ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (I want you back)
Na na na na
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I've seen you it is on
All I want
All I need
All I want
All I need
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby baby baby baby baby baby (I want you back)
Forget what happened then (I want you back)
And let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I've seen you it is on (I want you back)
Spare me of this cost (I want you back)
Give me back what I lost
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I'd show you that I love you
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, oh
I want you back
I want you back



Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so, baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playing with my heart, finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me let me know, baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand, I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline, feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Borderline, feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Keep on pushing me baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down, when I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away, I just wanna stay
There's something I just got to say

Just try to understand, I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline, feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Borderline, feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
Keep on pushing me baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Look what your love has done to me, come on baby, set me free
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline, borderline
You cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Keep on pushing me, keep on pushing me
Keep on pushing me, my love
(You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline)
Come baby, come darling, yeah

Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah



I've seen Jesus play with flames
In a lake of fire that I was standing in
Met the devil in Seattle
And spent nine months inside the lions den
Met Buddha yet another time
And he showed me a glowing light within
But I swear that God is there
Every time I glare into the eyes of my best friend

Says my son, "It's all been done
And someday you're gonna wake up old and gray
So go and try to have some fun
Showing warmth to everyone
You meet and greet and cheat along the way"

There's a gateway in our minds
That leads somewhere out there, far beyond this plane
Where reptile aliens made of light
Cut you open and pull out all your pain
Tell me how you make illegal
Something that we all make in our brain
Some say you might go crazy
But then again, it might make you go sane

Every time I take a look
Inside that old and fabled book
I'm blinded and reminded of
The pain caused by some old man in the sky
Marijuana, LSD
Psilocybin, and DMT
They all changed the way I see
But love's the only thing that ever saved my life

So don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes
Or fairy tales of blood and wine
It's turtles all the way down the line
So to each their own 'til we go home
To other realms our souls must roam
To and through the myth that we all call space and time



Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her
dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me,
tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other time
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway

Yeah, everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye?

If you're shoe shopping, walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patent leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
Yeah

You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy (easy)
Come dance with me 'cause dancing's free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes

Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene




Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared, I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Well, daddy grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere



I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good



Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm ok
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, ok

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older



Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart,
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
and never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the End Of The Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the End of the Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the End Of The Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the End of the Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you? Just come back to me (Lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely (Lonely)
My heart hurts baby (Lonely)

I feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Although we've come to the End Of The Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the End of the Road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
you belong to me
I belong to you

Being around you,

loving you whether, whether,
times are good or bad,

If you stay with me you can set me free woman
let's... let's stay together
loving you whether, whether,
times are good or bad,
happy or sad




I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says Leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says Find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore

And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me Go back home



All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me 
Rosanna

All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna

All I wanna tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say

Not quite a year since she went away
Who is it? Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna



I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would

I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh)
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh)
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
Oh oh whoa (oh oh whoa)
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would

Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

Whoa oh
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey



I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of the day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road along

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come



Now somewhere in the black minin' hills
Out Dakota there lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
One day his woman ran off with another guy.
Hit young Rocky in the eye.
Rocky didn't like that. Said, "I'm gonna get that boy."
So one day he walked into town,
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible.
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival.

His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil,
But everyone knew her as Nancy.

Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown.
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, he said,
"Danny boy, this is a showdown."

But Daniel was hot.
He drew first and shot,
And Rocky collapsed in the corner. Ah.

Da, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, now.

Doctor came in stinking of gin,
And proceeded to lie on the table.
He said, "Rocky, you met your match."
Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch.
And I'll be better. I'll be better, Doc,
As soon as I am able.

"Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible.
Gideon checked out and he left it, no doubt,
To help with good Rocky's revival.
Ah.. Yeah, yeah.

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo C'mon, Rocky boy..
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo C'mon, Rocky boy
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, the story of Rocky Raccoon.



I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
(Oh, oh)
Someone like me
(Oh, oh)
Someone like me (oh), somebody (oh)
(Oh, oh)

I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now
I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now

(Oh, oh)
Someone like you (oh), somebody (oh)
Someone like you (oh), somebody (oh)
Someone like you (oh), somebody (oh)

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see



I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that place 
Even your emotions had an echo 
in so much space 

And when you're out there 
Without care, 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice, that's my only advice 

Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are, 
Ha ha ha bless your soul 
You really think you're in control 

Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb 
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them 
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 

Maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably



How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe




It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Forever can never be long enough for me
Feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say
Hello in this cafe
Say you will
Mmm hmm
Say you will
Mmm hmm

Together can never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words I love you
And you're beautiful

Now that the wait is over
And love and has finally shown her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will
Mmm hmm
Say you will
Mmm hmm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to
Sing to you
When all the music dies

And marry me
Today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will
Mmm hmm
Say you will
Mmm hmm
Marry me
Mmm hmm



You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me (no you don't know me)

No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me (no you don't know me)

I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too (love me too)

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know me

I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too (love me too)

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know me
You don't know me
Oh you don't know me



You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

Help me
I broke apart my insides
Help me
I’ve got no soul to sell
Help me
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god

You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything

Help me
Tear down my reason
Help me
It's your sex I can smell
Help me
You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god

Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees
I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive




Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long years
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around Saint Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out,
"Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down

Woo, hoo
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!

Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame

Oh, hoo
woo, woo
Woo, who
Woo, woo
Woo, hoo, who
Woo, hoo, who
Oh, yeah

What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name



I got strung up from our loving
I wish you cared to see
But she only cares when she's got the time
And I fret so much about our loving
I wish she'd let me be
But our destinies got us intertwined

And is it really my fault
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

What is she thinking, too much uncertainty
Why can't she give some sort of sign
You know and I know, a thing or two about loyalty
Ooh but that girl don't pay no mind

So is it really my fault
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, tu tu tu

I get strung up from her loving
I wish she cared to see
But she only cares when she so inclined
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But her destiny got us so intertwined

Back in 2011, I decided
To not let this play with my mind
But when the boys from out of town
They come back around
I feel like committing a crime, yeah

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it

I get jealous, (ooh ooh ooh) but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, (ooh ooh ooh) talk to my girl I ain't with it

I get jealous, (ooh ooh ooh) but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, (ooh ooh ooh) talk to my girl I ain't with it



I want to vanish
This is my fondest wish
To go where I cannot be captured
Laid on a decorated dish
Even in splendor this curious fate
Is more than I care to surrender
Now it's too late

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

If you should stumble upon my last remark
I'm crying in the wilderness
I'm trying my best to make it dark
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most
I'm certain as a lost dog
Pondering a sign post

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

I want to vanish
This is my last request
I've given you the awful truth
Now give me my rest



You were a child
Crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud
But your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants
No time to think of consequences

Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted

The water is warm
But it's sending me shivers
A baby is born
Crying out for attention
The memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made
And not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not

Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees



Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering in the words
to melt everyone
but you stay so cool

My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Monalisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
or else forget about it

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
or else forget about it

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it



I'm wearing that dress
I've pulled on those gloves
I put on my veil
we once were in love
We once had it all
the entire sky
We threw it away
and I wonder why

Passion's always half impossibility
But lovers that we lose we never dare forget
We visit them in mourning in December and in May
In the graveyard of Saint Mary's of Regret

The end of the street
the wrought-iron gate
The cobblestone path
the names and the date
The anxious hello
the everyday laugh
The intimate tears
the epitaph

Passion's always half impossibility
But lovers that we lose we never dare forget
We visit them in mourning in December and in May
In the graveyard of Saint Mary's of Regret

You're married by now
She's kind I suppose
Does she know what she has?
Does she tell you she knows?
Do you put on the suit?
Do you try on the tie?
Do you walk through that gate?
Do you wonder why?

Passion's always half impossibility
But lovers that we lose we never dare forget
Maybe someday there I'll see you in December or in May
In the graveyard of Saint Mary's of Regret
In the graveyard of Saint Mary's of Regret

We never dare forget



I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart 

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?

Have you got color in your cheeks
Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something's in your teeth
And some aces up your sleeve
I had no idea that you're in deep

I dreamt about you near me every night this week
How many secrets can you keep
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
When I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

If this feeling flows both ways (Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together, if you wanted to

If this feeling flows both ways (Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
(calling when you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

(do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways (Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day
Too busy being yours to fall (Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling? (Do I wanna know)
Do you want me crawling back to you?



You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out, 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halo, halo
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo




I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

Your ocean eyes (no fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mine

And those ocean eyes (no fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes (no fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes



Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered
I'm yours

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered
I'm yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done a lot of foolish things 
that I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered
I'm yours, oh I'm yours

Ooh wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered
I'm yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand 
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
oh, you've got the future in your hand 
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done a lot of foolish things 
that I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am

With your future, got your future babe (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)



Just the guitar
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, um
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), um
Baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), um
There's only one way down
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We've both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more
I'm giving you up

If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more



The bats are in the belfry
The dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me
And pledged her love before?
And pledged her love before

And it's such a sad old feeling
All the fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream

I made a golden promise
That we would never part
I gave my love a locket
And then I broke her heart
And then I broke her heart

And it's such a sad old feeling
All of the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream

We're running through the graveyard
And we laughed, my friends and I
We swore we'd be together
Until the day we died
Until the day we died

And it's such a sad old feeling
All of the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream

And it's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream




You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south
London town

You check out guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Savin' it up, for Friday night
With the Sultans
We're the Sultans of Swing

Then a crowd a young boys they're foolin' around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
Goodnight, now it's time to go home
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing

Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

That boy is baggage, draggin' you down
Shoulda left him in the lost and found
Solo so long, you're lonely now

You're jonesing for a piece of open sky
A little bit of runway shy
It's high time you kissed gravity goodbye

By the seat of your blue jeans
On the wings of a big dream
Leavin' them smoke rings and the clouds behind
Your co-pilot is your heart of gold
Watch the world disappear below
Come on baby, don't you know?
That's the only way to fly

A leap a faith and gonna launch yourself
Pick a star right off the shelf
You'll be over the moon by sunrise

A tailwind and a little grace
Will get you all the way to outer space
So mission control it's T-minus ten, nine, eight

By the seat of your blue jeans
On the wings of a big dream
Leavin' them smoke rings and the clouds behind
Your co-pilot is your heart of gold
Watch the world disappear below
Come on baby, don't you know?
Oh, that's the only way to fly

By the seat of your blue jeans
On the wings of a big dream
Leavin' them smoke rings and the clouds behind
Your co-pilot is your heart of gold
Watch the world disappear below
Come on baby, don't you know?
Yeah, that's the only way to fly
Yeah, that's the only way to fly, fly, fly, yeah



Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words was do not disturb
Checkout was s'posed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our
hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our
hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left a night I can't forget, but

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our
hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah she kept it

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our
hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah she kept it
She kept the hotel key 
Mm
She kept the hotel key



I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well he just drove off sometimes life's ok
I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did I say
Well you just laughed it off it was all ok

And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on any way well

Well, a fake jamaican took every last dime with that a scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand
Bad news comes don't you worry even when it hands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on the exactly the same day
Well we'll float on good news is on the way

And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on ok
And we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on

Even if things get heavy we'll all float on
Alright already we'll all float on

All float on



A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah

His sister's black but she is sho'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord, her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city

Her brother's smart, he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah

Llving just enough for the city
Llving just enough for the city
Llving just enough for the city
Llving just enough for the city
Llving just enough for the city
Llving just enough for the city

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh

Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
Can't help but stare 'cause I got the best seat

Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees.
Alright

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, copper tone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Slow driving south with the drop top down
Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this."
I don't wanna get D.W.K.
driving while kissing they'll put you away

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, copper tone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Well, you hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burn me up and down, no way to cool it
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, copper tone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey



For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad type
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad



Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
and a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
I'm on fire




I sense a runner in the garden
Although my judgements known to fail
Once built a steamboat in a meadow
'Cause I'd forgotten how to sail

I know the runner's going to tell you
There ain't no cowboy in my hair
So now he's buried by the daisies
So I could stay the tallest man
in your eyes, babe

I sense a spy up in the chimney
From all the evidence I've burned
I guess he'll read it in the smoke now
And soon to ashes I'll return

I know the spy is going to tell you
It's not my flag up in the pole
So now he's buried by the lilies
So I could stay forevermore
in your eyes, babe

I sense a leak inside my phone now
From all the lies I have told
I know he has your private number
And soon he'll make that vicious call

I know the leak is going to tell you
There ain't now puppy in your leash
So now he'll fertilize the roses
So I could stay the king you see
In your eyes, babe

I know the leak is going to tell you
There ain't now puppy in your leash
So now he'll fertilize the roses
So I could stay the king you see
In your eyes, babe

So now we're dancing through the garden
And what a garden I have made
And now that death will grow my jasmine
I find it soothing I'm afraid

Now there is no need for suspicion
There ain't no frog kissing your hand
I won't be lying when I tell you
That I'm a gardener I'm a man
In your eyes babe



Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids
plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets to find who's right and who's wrong

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful

A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, Jets, Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets



My tea's gone cold, I wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life.




Baby can't you see?
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from the devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
Oh, the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison, I'm in paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now
(I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now



Thought I'd end up with Sean
But it wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see

She packed my bag last night, preflight
Zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high
As a kite by then

I miss the earth so much
I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them
If you did

And all this science
I don't understand
It's just my job
Five days a week
A rocket man
Rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time



She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there

'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and

You shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long

Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

'Cause the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and

You shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long
And knocked me out and then you
Shook me all night long
You had me shakin' and you
Shook me all night long

Yeah you shook me
Well you took me
You really took me and

You shook me all night long
Ooh you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you
Shook me all night long
You really took me and you
Yeah you shook me, yeah you shook me
All night long

We were both young
When I first saw you
I closed my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

I see the lights
See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
'Til my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin' you Please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quiet
'Cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo
I was a Scarlett Letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
And I was beggin' you Please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

Romeo save me
They're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo save me
I've been feelin' so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring

And says

Marry me Juliet
You never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

Oh oh
Oh oh oh

'Cause we were both young
When I first saw you



Sometimes I feel
like I am drunk behind the wheel
The wheel of possibility
however it may roll
Give it a spin
see if it can somehow factor in
You know there's always more than one way
To say exactly what you mean to say

Was I out of my head, was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too

Was I out of my head, was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too

Was I out of my head, was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an invitation
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet but I finally woke up
If you're sad
then it's time you spoke up
too

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

His mother told him "Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode



Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now

See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, Mmm, all right now

Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Oh

Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good

Mmm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say

Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say

Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Oh
It's all right, It's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, Baby, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, Oh yeah!

Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right



You say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me 'til this day

You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

All the times
When we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there is only one thing that I can say

You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
Didn't stand by me
No way
You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?

Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?

Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way




Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning (uh)
The force of love beginning

(Look)

We've come too far to give up who we are

I'm outta luck, outta love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I want to touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh oh, look what you've done

Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild so free and far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you

Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
You've gone straight to my head

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you

Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
I want to touch you
oh

Photograph
Photograph your photograph
Photograph
Photograph I need only your
Photograph I'm outta love
Photograph I'm outta love
Photograph you're the only one
Photograph I want to touch




Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me,
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
they are fighting

With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head
In your head they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie Zombie Zombie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie Zombie Zombie
Oh

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head,
In your head
they're still fightin'

With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head
In your head they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie Zombie Zombie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie Zombie Zombie



I, was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I was the prototype like three stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low
Lie, lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Hey!

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low



Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby
picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
lives in a dream
Waits at the window
wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
who is it for?

All the lonely people
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
no one comes near
Look at him working
darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
what does he care?

All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby
died in the church and was buried along with her name
nobody came
Father McKenzie
wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
no one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
where do they all belong?



When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love




Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, Call it compulsive
Call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop

It's a matter of instinct
It's a matter of conditioning and a matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov's Dog
Ring a bell and I'll salivate
How'd you like that?
Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue

'Cause right now I'm lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did

So I'm lying here
Just staring at the ceiling tiles
And I'm thinking about, oh what to think about
Just listening and relistening
To Smiley Smile
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought

Because I'm lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did, whoa

And if you want to find me
I'll be out in the sandbox
Just wondering where the hell all the love has gone
I'm playing my guitar and building
Castles in the sun, oh oh oh
And singing "Fun, Fun, Fun"

Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did, whoa

I had a dream
That I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
Somebody, I couldn't see the ground
Somebody, I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me

Because I'm lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did, yeah

Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive
You can call it insane, oh oh
But when I'm surrounded
I just can't stop




Well, I'm so above you
And it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I don't mind bleedin'
Any old time, you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'

Well, your mama kept you
But your daddy left you
And I should've done you just the same
But I came to love you
Am I born to bleed?
Any old time, you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'

Hey

Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, whoa, oh
I got a love that keeps me waitin'




What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key. 

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
hmm I get high with a little help from my friends,
hmm Gonna try with a little help from my friends. 

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
hmm I get high with a little help from my friends,
hmm Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
 
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
hmm I get high with a little help from my friends,
Oh Gonna try with a little help from my friends.
 
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love,
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
hmm Gonna try with a little help from my friends,
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



They put a parking lot on a piece of land 
When the supermarket used to stand. 
Before that they put up a bowling alley 
On the site that used to be the local palais. 
That's where the big bands used to come and play. 
My sister went there on a Saturday. 

Come dancing, 
All her boyfriends used to come and call. 
Why not come dancing, it's only natural? 

Another Saturday, another date. 
She would be ready but she's always make them wait. 
In the hallway, in anticipation, 
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration. 
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week 
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek. 

Come dancing, 
That's how they did it when I was just a kid, 
And when they said come dancing, 
My sister always did. 

My sister should have come in a midnight, 
And my mum would always sit up and wait. 
It always ended up in a big row 
When my sister used to get home late. 

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight, 
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate. 

The day they knocked down the palais 
My sister stood and cried. 
The day they knocked down the palais 
Part of my childhood died, just died. 

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band, 
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand. 
My sister's married and she lives on an estate. 
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait. 
She knows they get away with things she never could, 
But if I asked her I wonder if she would, 

Come dancing, 
Come on sister, have yourself a ball. 
Don't be afraid to come dancing, 
It's only natural. 

Come dancing, 
Just like the palais on a Saturday. 
And all her friends will come dancing 
Where the big bands used to play. 




Son of a gun

You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot

You had one eye in the mirror
As you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave

But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?

I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun

Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with
Some underworld spy
or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you now?

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go (Let me go.)
Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mama mia, mama mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows



Hit it!
This ain't no disco
This ain't no country club either, This is L.A.

All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too
the matches and the Buds, and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, 'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell ya, that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard



It's a simple song for simple feeling
You see the moon and watch it rise
Across the continent the night bird sings
And somewhere someone hears its cry

So disillusioned keep your head down
If you do they'll never know
You'll have no answers to their questions
And they will have to let you go

And disenfranchised Revolution
They'll take away by right what's yours
And make you martyrs of your own cause
When they don't know what cause it's for

And all deserted stand alerted
They'll love you when you're all alone
But you find a red rose in the morning light
You wait the night and find it gone

So hear my words with faith and passion
For what I say to you is true
And when you find the one you might become
Remember part of me is you




I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy




To lead a better life,
I need my love to be here.

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there.

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care.
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care.
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.

I will be there, and everywhere.
Here, there and everywhere.



This is a story about Billy Joe and Bobby Sue
Two young lovers with nothin' better to do
Except sit around the house, get high and watch the tube

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing 
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
No we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change



He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you

I went to see him just today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

Ya know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today



Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things 
Define what's within

I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be 
With no-one to share with, 
no-one who truly cares for me 

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

If I ain't got you with me baby
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby



There is freedom within
there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
there's a hole in the roof
my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
in the paper today
tales of war and of waste
but you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, Hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, Hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know they won't win

Don't let them win
Hey now, Hey now
Hey now, Hey now
Hey now, Hey now
Don't let them win
They come, They come
Don't let them win
Hey now, Hey now (yeah)
Hey now, Hey now



I got these fresh eyes
never seen you before like this
My God, you're beautiful
It's like the first time
when we open the door
Before we got used to usual

It might seem superficial
stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little
and I'm like, "Oh, damn"

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes

Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes
But I, I'll ride that wave with you
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

Maybe all of this is simple
My heart's unconditional, yeah
You dress up just a little
and I'm like, "Oh, damn"

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes

If I could bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
I would bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
'Cause you're gorgeous in this moment
If I could bottle this up, I would

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes
fresh eyes




Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately I been, I been losing sleep

Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money and watch it burn

Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin',
Someone told me not to cry

Now that I'm older,
My heart's colder,
And I can see that it's a lie

Children wake up,
Hold your mistake up,
Before they turn the summer into dust

If the children don't grow up,
Our bodies get bigger
but our hearts get torn up.
We're just a million little god's causin' rain storms
turnin' every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust

With my lightnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin' to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand

With my lightnin' bolts a-glowin'
I can see where I am goin'
With my lightnin' bolts a-glowin'
I can see where I am go goin'
You better look down below



Well, I'm running down the road
tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you s''til can
don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
and such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
though we will never be here again
so open up, I'm climbin' in
so take it easy

Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
got a world of trouble on my mind
lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
she's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy



I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you
you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes (oh baby)
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you
you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard
if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you
you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key



She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar-pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Standing in line marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says "Get a job"

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them

They say hey little boy you can't go
Where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do
Said hey old man how can you stand
To think that way
Did you really think about it
Before you made the rules
He said, Son

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them

Well they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
Because the law another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them



I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message just keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere just living
In a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write
This book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying
Over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about
Your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark



What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what's it all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get a life of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
No, no, I'll never fall in love again

I'm out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again



I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm hmm, that's what people say, mmm hmm
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm mmm, that's what people say mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind, sayin' gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm mmm, that's what they don't see mmm mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm mmm, that's what they don't know mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats in the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake, yeah oh
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate me)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (the fakers baby)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me
Out of my head
While you never shed a tear

Remember, I remember
All that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river

I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you



Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop



I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl
beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were
the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
we're listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling
you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love
to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling
you look perfect tonight

Oh, no, no
Mm

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
we're listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight



Some people call me the space cowboy yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

People talk about me baby
Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
But don't you worry baby don't worry
'Cause I'm right here right here right here at home

'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
Sure don't want to hurt no one

'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches
Want to shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Ooh wee baby, I sure show you a good time

'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run

I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner

You're the cutest thing I ever did see
Really love your peaches want to shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Come on baby now, I'll show you a good time



Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah,you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?



I turned the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over



Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into goin' out
With hopes you were stayin' in

I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was dropping
Thunder lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
And if I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving
Thunder lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

You hit me Category five
With your smile, blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'

The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was dropping
Thunder lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane



You can come over
You can sit on the back porch
We can take a walk
When it gets colder
You can climb in my car
Yeah, we can talk

Sit up all night if you like
I just can't let your restless feet
Find my front steps

It'd be too easy
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before
You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But you can't come in

I'd put on that record
You'd give me that look
Oh, you know the one
Boy, I can betcha
By the end of that first verse
The damage would be done
'Cause one glass of wine always leads to two
When it comes to me and you

It'd be too easy
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before
You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But you can't come in

And pretend like we're just a couple old friends
Like you don't know how our story ends

You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But 'til I get over you
You can't come in



Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free

One short year our love burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done?
Once we were as sweet and warm as the golden morning sun

Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free

Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine
'Cause if you don't the devil will

Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
Hearts on fire




(One, two, three, four)
Ooh

Every time you come around
you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down
I let you take control
I can feel the paradise
before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends
when the good times start
Falling over everything
to reach the first-time spark
It started under neon lights
and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you



Oh, where have you been, my blue eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you meet, my blue eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son?
And, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
And the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.



We took a u-turn down on 42nd street
Almost hit another car
Spilled my coffee on my jeans and I said
"Aw, they're ruined now"
She said
"Naw, they're better now. It's just a matter of perspective."
She kissed my cheek
It's the little imperfections that make 'em unique
I don't know how she does it, but she could

See the stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
I know I ain't much but
That girl sees something nobody else can see
Maybe she sees something in me
If she could see the stars in the city

The more I hang with her the more I realize
There can be beauty in the broken if you open up your mind
She says thinks like
"Ain't this rain nice" and
"Don't sad songs make you smile"
Well if she's crazy
I wanna be crazy too
She's the kinda girl that can break up a band
I wanna see whatever she can

See the stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
I know I ain't much but
That girl sees something nobody else can see
Maybe she sees something in me
If she could see the stars in the city

That girl sees something nobody else can see
Maybe she sees something in me
If she could see the stars in the city
In the city

See the stars in the city
The stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
So pretty she can break you heart
Yeah she sees the stars in the city
In the city
She sees the stars in the city
Yeah




Mama got a call from the Principal's office
Better get down here fast
'Cause Mandy passed out when her water broke in the middle of geometry class
Her mama didn't know she was nine months late
Been gettin' on her 'bout gainin' weight
And now she's a grandma

Somebody had a baby
Somebody had a breakdown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town

Willy Smith swore he wouldn't miss one more
Of Junior's football games
Got his twelve-pack o' Bud and his Friday night buzz
Headin' south in the northbound lane
Junior's the endzone, halfback pitch
Willy's sittin' upside-down in a ditch
And the crowd goes wild

Somebody wrecked a pickup
Somebody score a touchdown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town

There ain't no mall, no waffle house
But there's always somethin' to talk about
Around here, somebody shot a deer
Somebody's gettin' married, buried, or carried away
If the sun comes up
And the sun goes down
Ah, it's a big day
In a small town

Rumor goin' 'round about a methodist man
And a jailbait checkout queen
His wife caught wind of unspeakable sin
Goin' down on Aisle Thirteen
She left all the chicken in the fryin' pan
Drew all the kids in the grand caravan
With a baseball bat

Somebody went to Walmart
In nothin' but a nightgown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town

There ain't no mall, no waffle house
But there's always somethin' to talk about
Around here, somebody shot a deer
Somebody's gettin' married, buried, or carried away
If the sun comes up
And the sun goes down
Ah, it's a big day
In a small town



You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
Childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your mama says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be waste of time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
I love you ain't no pick up line so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin'
Don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind



It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe

This is a love attack, I know, went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shun, you might as well be walkin' on the sun

Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there?

Some were spellbound, some were hellbound
Some they fell down and some got back up
And fought back against the melt-down
And their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shun, you might as well be walkin' on the sun

And it ain't no joke when our mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't reform, no God-like hocus-pocus

So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack put you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shun, you might as well be walkin' on the sun

you might as well be walkin' on the sun
you might as well be walkin' on the sun
you might as well be walkin' on the sun
you might as well be walkin' on the sun




You say it's over, with a middle finger
But then you're calling before I turn off my ringer
And I answer 'cause I love to hear you're sorry for the four hundreth time

Well,
You try to leave me
But you can't do it
'Cause I'm the only one who puts up with your (censorship)
I know that secretly you love making out with me right after we fight

Well,
We're always fixing something that was never broken
We're on and off again like sobriety
Get back together every time you're done throwing a fit
So when you gonna quit
Breaking up with me

Well,
You think by now
We'd finally get along
But we only feel right when everything is going wrong
And we're back in the habit of cussing each other up and down

Well,
I hate your daddy, you hate my mama
But one thing we don't seem to hate is all the drama
But we never can remember what the hell we were yelling about

Well,
We're always fixing something that was never broken
We're on and off again like sobriety
Get back together every time you're done throwing a fit
So when you gonna quit
Breaking up with me

I don't know where you think you're going
Because you're stuck with me forever and you know it
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)

We're always fixing something that was never broken
We're on and off again like sobriety
Get back together every time you're done throwing a fit
So when you gonna quit
Breaking up with me

Yeah
And when you're gonna quit
Breaking up with me
But you know it (forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever)

Yeah



White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste

Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Now angel will die

Covered in white, closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, now we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper-hand
Go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly, fly, fly
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die



Ow!

I get up
and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough
I've seen the toughest around
And I know
baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches
and get to what's real

Ah, can't ya see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead an' jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

Ow oh! Hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know

So can't ya see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Get in and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
Jump!

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Huh, so baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Yeah, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Huh, so baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
Then I turned on those KC lights
And drove all night 'cause it felt so right
Her and I, man, we feel so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords and sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you

Well, baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw, yeah



I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
Ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you now

I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I got a girl crush
I got a girl crush

I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind

I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I got a girl crush

I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down



I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up girl it's
just a break up run and
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'cause I raised ya better
gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic like a
Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run and
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised ya better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your I's
and never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up well it's, just a break up run and
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised ya better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart




Ayy
My girl is bangin'
She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty (frosty)

But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeak squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama jamma, she my Dixieland delight (ayy)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

(Ooh)
(Fancy like, ooh)
(Fancy like, ooh)
(Fancy like, ooh)

Uh, don't need no Tesla to impress her (don't need no Tesla to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (there she go)
Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (ooh, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (slow dancin')

But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (that's right)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top too (gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (styrofoam)
Squeak squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (all the way home)
Some Alabama jamma, she my Dixieland delight (ayy)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

My new clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keeping some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine and her up-do goes down

Ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (that's right)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top too (gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (styrofoam)
Squeak squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (all the way home)
Some Alabama jamma, she my Dixieland delight (ayy)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

Ooh, stop
Ooh

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
Bump into me, swear he's
Tryin' a talk to me, say wait wait

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love

With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
She's an uptown girl



She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh sweet child o' mine
Oh sweet love of mine
Oh sweet child o' mine
Oh sweet love of mine
Oh sweet child o' mine
Oh sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child
Where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay ay, ay
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine



Life is too far to walk alone
You can't do it on your own
It's like bare hands digging through stone

And if things go down much steeper hills
Even money won't pay these bills
And time will show, show, show

That people gonna be OK
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other

And I can get so high on myself sometimes
I keep on drifting a million miles from this planet
But what a shame it would be to look back on our life
And realize that I've taken you and me for granted
Not gonna do it now

People gonna be OK
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other

And I cannot see what's a mile around the bend
I don't know where this world is headed
Or where it may end
But you gave me this smile
And so I threw away my frown
And I ain't gonna pick up
Something if I just put it down

People gonna be OK
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other

People gonna be OK
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other



To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
"I'm On Fire" and I'm "Born To Run"
You looked at me and I was done
But we, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

From back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear "Born in the USA"
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Whoa, Springsteen

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Some people clap on the one and three
Some people clap on the two and four
Some people don't join at all
'Cause they got no rhythm
And that's alright

Some people, they drink too much
Some people don't drink enough
Some people are just like me
I hope y'all forgive 'em

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

If I was sweet tea, it'd be a bit bitter
If you took a drink, you might reconsider
If I was a church, I'd be hanging with the sinners
Talking 'bout Hendrix and Heaven
If I was a bar, I'd be a dive
A free jukebox in a double-wide
Neon lights saying "Come inside"
And I'd be Open 24 7

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

Yeah, I'm hard to love, it's true
I'm a little more rough than smooth
It's a wonder I found somebody like me, like you

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone
Yeah, I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone



On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street
heads turning all day when they see you with me

I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's
coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you
like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

Black dress, to the 9s, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me

Like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin'
from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Come on baby you look good
You look good
Baby you look good



Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many
one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
And it's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many
and one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
that do you in
Ooh ooh ooh

You and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many
one more is never enough
Never enough

You and tequila (mm)
You and tequila make me crazy
Ooh ooh

No it ain't my fault

Blame my reason on my name
Blame my name on my reason
Blame my lack of knowing better

Blame smoke on the fire

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money
For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
All right, all right



We were as one babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine

Now you wanna be free
So I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way

But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I will always be



Stuck on you
(I've) Got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Stuck on you
Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I thrown them all away
'Cause this time little darling
I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feelin' down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed



I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sundays
Or an ice cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen mama gave me a curfew
But it was, "son you're under my roof, then you're under my rules"

I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
Some of it I'll never understand

But they got their reasons
just like you
When you walked out of my life
when you didn't have to
You send me reeling
there's nothing I can do
About you takin' my heart
and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some bar room off the deep end
I got my reasons

I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

But they got their reasons
just like you
When you walked out of my life
when you didn't have to
You send me reeling
there's nothing I can do
About you takin' my heart
and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some bar room off the deep end
I got my reasons

Some are good, and some are bad
Some are true, and some are sad
Everyone's got some
but I need one that brings you back

We all got our reasons
just like you
When you walked out of my life
when you didn't have to
You send me reeling
there's nothing I can do
About you takin' my heart
and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soaking in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some bar room off the deep end
I got my reasons
Whoa, I got my reasons
Yeah, I got my reasons
