sure so you don’t need to go borrow equipment from anybody to do the feet to do the hooves well we’re gonna have to find somewhere to get something so I’m gonna we’re not gonna do the feet today I’m gonna wait till like early in the morning to do those cause I mean you get so tired and you just it takes well it takes me longer than most people cause you know I’m not as strong and I’m not as good as like somebody that would do it all the time you know I mean I trim horses and stuff like that but I mean I’m not like I’m not uh I don’t know how to say it but you know they do it for a living you know most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time and I’m not that good or and I’m not very strong did they train you yeah did they train you that yeah yeah so you have your own equipment but no I don’t have my own equipment at all dad you know has done some of it that’s another thing too is I kinda had a general idea of kinda how to do it just watching him or and watching people come to our place and doing it and stuff you know and I don’t know then down there it’s mandatory you have to to graduate you know or well to get the degree you know you have to take this class and you can only take if you want to you can only take it for eight weeks and if you wanna go on in it then you can go on you know and I decided to go ahead and go on in it and the first part of it is like well we have lecture then we have lab and like the first part of it we just go into the classroom and he like in the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work I mean it that’s just kinda how it happens you know because he kinda has to tell you they go over the whole the whole part of the horse I mean all the skeleton part of it you know and and they go through every kinda ligament and I mean there’s there’s millions of ligaments and millions of tendons you know well not millions but I mean yeah I bet and so we had to know these tendons and ligaments and then all the bones and you know all the way up from the shoulder down and then from the hip down you know all the way down to the hoof and then the bone in the hoof and then all the wall and you know of the hoof and what everything was called there and then he went over on how to trim it and where you there’s a white line that you go by and a horse has this little white line and you clean it out with the with the hoof knife you know and then there and then you can see this little white line and that’s kinda where you go by you know the horse kinda helps you out because it has that little white line right there mhm and that’s where you kinda kinda need a little guide of where you trim and I am still scared to do it because you know I mean you can make a horse go lame by doing it really well you can trim em too short and make em you know and they’re just a little bit for f the first couple of days you know I mean they’re just sore that’s not bad but sometimes you can get it really bad you can really make a horse really bad and they you know then they have to like keep em away from anything you know get em really in the soft ground and no hard pebbles or hard clods of dirt or anything so I don’t know I’m a little scared about doing it yet you know I get em really long I mean they’re still long when I get done with them a lot of times like I’ll get done and I’ll think I’m done and I’ll look at look down at the horse’s hoof and it’s still it’s too long and then like I would never ever ever trust myself to shoe a horse see we did that too we did a lot of stuff we did a lot of stuff with the like we had the the burners you know and you’d put the you’d have you started out with the straight iron you know and you’d stick it into the into the you know like actual blacksmithing and you’d put it into the hot coals you know and then we’d we straight bar and we’d make it a a horseshoe out of it you know but these shoes we never did put on a horse we just put the shoes that were already made throat throat on a horse and that’s as far as we got I mean if you would really get into it well as a matter of fact this is really funny you know there isn’t really any girl farriers around anywhere they’re really farrier th yeah farrier is what they’re called and the the reason they were showing us this at college was just to get us to know if our trimmer and shoer were doing it right and plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments which we we had it in another class too we that was kind of a double thing that we had in in another class so it was kinda review for us well it was a review for some people depend on what time of the year you took it you know if it was a review or not but anyway what was I gonna say you said you never made the horseshoes but well when we put em on a horse’s hoof all we do they’re already made they’re round we pick out a size you know we’d like look at the horse’s hoof and say okay this is a double aught this is an aught this is you know what size and double aught and aught are the ones that are most popular for the light horse you know I mean you get into the big horses the like the Clydesdales Shires that’s a d a whole different thing or ponies that’s a whole different thing but we’re talking just the regular light horses you know and aught and aught uh aught and double aught are the two sizes well anyway you go get your okay this is after you trimmed em and you go get your shoe it’s already made it’s already round you pick out your size you go look and every horse’s hoof is shaped different it doesn’t matter every horse is gonna have a little different shape so every every uh horseshoe is made custom made for the horse then no no no what what we do then that’s that’s where the farrier comes in every shoe is like you get order you know I would like a case of double aught shoes you’d get the farrier gets em you know that’s the way it goes and then our job is to shape the shoe to the horse’s foot and that it sounds easy but it’s really hard to do I mean some of em you have to you know like say okay say your shoe’s like this and your horse’s foot is just really wide or something well then you have to put it on the anvil and get the shoe stretched out well then once you stretch the shoe out well then the two corners they go out too you know okay your shoe’s like this you stretch this out well then it’s gonna make these go way out too and they get like this right then you have to round these back you know it’s just it sounds easy but it’s really hard to do and then I would never do it cause I’d never trust myself to do it I mean we had to do it but it’s just that people would volunteer their horses to the college because it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod I mean that’s just how much it costs could you imagine all those horses out there if we had em all shod that’s how many have you got thirty bucks for twenty horses twenty twenty eight horses you know I mean Jesus that would be a th nine hundred dollars just like that I mean could you imagine so we you know like a lot of people that have a lot of horses and stuff and that they’re riding a lot they’ll just let the college kids do em for em you know they’re taking the risk of having their horse get lame but it really never happens cause we have our instructor right there telling us this is what you do and it’s not like there’s a person that’s just gung ho and goes and just trims their feet and puts the shoe on you know you d you d you can’t do that and so we have our instructor right there and we asked a million questions all the time I mean he just runs around everywhere you know so it’s but uh what was I gonna say oh and it’s really tiring though and it you know like you get so I’ve only done like well at the end of the year now see I took the second half of the course and right now I’ve probably only shod about five horses trimmed a lot of em and you know what we start out with this is the grossest of everything what we start out we start out with dead horse hooves I mean you know the the canneries you know and stuff you know the people that kill the horses for meat and stuff you know they have all these legs and stuff and I don’t know everybody I thought they used the throat the horse hooves in for gelatin that’s not so you know I think they do I think a lot of times but then they they probably use em for everything I don’t know what all they use em for but anyway we get these horse hooves from this one cannery they they have to go a long ways to go get em like back East somewhere to get these horse hooves for the college they go back East and they get em and they freeze em you know so we have this frozen horse hoof that we have to start out on cause you don’t want to cripple up a really good horse and like my first hoof that horse would have been lame like crazy but it was just and oh God it’s so gross because sometimes if you get one that’s been thawed out a little bit they start really stinking and stuff oh it’s the grossest thing oh it’s just so icky I mean you have this piece of horse like this leg that’s oh it’s just gross and like in some of em blood will spurt out you know and I mean oh it’s nothing it’s the grossest thing and that’s why that’s probably why they have to make that class mandatory because at the beginning of the year it’s just the it’s the pits but once you get into it it’s the funnest thing and you know it’s really interesting to do stuff like
